# DEVLOG — payloadguard-evidence

Append-only session log. Every session adds one dated entry (UTC), newest
first, citing commit SHAs. Timestamps below are taken from the git history
and run manifests, not reconstructed from memory.

## 2026-07-04 18:52 UTC — Documentation pass: README, SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT, DEVLOG

- Root `README.md` populated (was an empty scaffold placeholder): purpose,
  non-goals, claims-discipline table including EXAMPLE_CHECKED, end-to-end
  flow, worked-example walkthrough, honesty exhibits, run instructions,
  known limitations.
- `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` created: component map, data-flow diagram,
  invariants (R1/R2 encoded), evidence inventory, Phase A/B boundary.
- `DEVLOG.md` created with the full dated history of the repository to date.
- No code, schema, kernel, or evidence changes in this session.

## 2026-07-04 16:40–16:42 UTC — Phase A closeout rulings (f5977d0, 96eaeee, d23689a)

Implemented the three rulings ratified after the Phase A audit. Kernels
untouched; one commit per ruling.

- **R1 (f5977d0):** `intent_ok` made requirement-scoped and derived exactly
  once at bind time (`derive_intent` in `matrix_variants.py`); all variant
  views carry it read-only, variant C assembles the full two-method model
  before filtering, variant B shadows project the parent value. Verified
  uniform across A / B parents / both C views (1-4-12 false, 1-8-1 false,
  DOSE-003 true). Same-facts check re-run: 7 facts, set-equal.
  RECONCILIATION asymmetry (1) closed; asymmetry (2) annotated deferred to
  Phase B.
- **R2 (96eaeee):** PROVEN rule made structural, not textual. Inline
  `intended PROVEN, realized …` notes restored (quoting authored metadata is
  fidelity). `assert_no_realized_proven()` fails generation if any realized
  strength equals PROVEN; committed as pytest over the four real artifacts
  plus in-memory corruption cases. Grep audit retired. Base Option A
  matrices untouched. Suite: 11 passed.
- **R3 (d23689a):** class-(2) incompleteness reframed: the IEEE-faithful
  channel exists but is unreliably sampled and sharply complexity-dependent
  (confirmed on the one-operation probe, silent on the four-parameter kernel
  under identical invocation; recorded bounds do not disclose the regime).
  Both exhibit pins' `mechanism_attribution` updated to match the README —
  verified identical modulo self-reference. Old "invisible" phrasing gone.

## 2026-07-04 16:15–16:26 UTC — Phase A completion T1–T4-C (0894da2…274115d)

- **T1 (0894da2):** BOUNDED_CHECKED incompleteness split into search-budget
  vs model-fidelity classes; CrossHair changelog cited (v0.0.72 real-valued
  float modelling, v0.0.58 nan/±inf as arguments only).
- **T2 (82a18a0):** naive-widening exhibit pinned
  (`exhibit_pin_naive_widening.json`): crosshair-tool 0.0.107, Python
  3.11.15, platform, exact invocation, mechanism attribution,
  version-contingency note.
- **T3 (d66162f):** domain-free `overflow_probe.py`. Expected a miss;
  CrossHair **confirmed** the violation (`double_it(8.98846567431158e+307)`
  → inf, exit 1). Recorded as-is, not re-rolled — paired with Sample C it
  measures the FP channel's width. Deterministic pytest companion added.
- **T4-0 (88bf755):** concrete evidence foundation — four requirement-mapped
  cases in `tests/test_dosage_concrete.py` (single CASES source), captured
  verbatim (pytest 4 passed) plus structured `concrete_results.json`.
  `Strength.EXAMPLE_CHECKED` added to the model.
- **T4-A/B/C (c2768da, 5745e0b, 274115d):** three parallel schema variants
  generated from identical evidence — A: evidence array per requirement
  (3 rows / 7 records); B: shadow pseudo-requirements with machine-enforced
  `parent_requirement` (7 rows); C: dual matrices partitioned by method
  (3 symbolic / 4 concrete rows), one filter-parametrised renderer.
  `RECONCILIATION.md`: programmatic same-facts confirmation (7 fact tuples)
  plus four recorded asymmetries. All schemas validated positive + negative.

## 2026-07-04 15:34 UTC — Option A amendment (b090d54)

Post-ship review found REQ-GIP-1-8-1's verification vacuous: the
`infusion_rate_ml_per_hr >= 0` precondition made the negative-dose clamp
dead code, so the postcondition's lower bound held by algebra. Applied
Option A: precondition widened to any finite rate (negative models the GIP
SR 1.8.1 single-fault reverse flow), directional postcondition added
(negative rate ⇒ return exactly 0.0), and the negative check reordered
before the finiteness check — a naive widening would have returned the
MAXIMUM dose on a −inf overflow. The naive variant and its real CrossHair
capture (exit 0 — the violation was NOT found) were committed deliberately
as the honesty exhibit. Sample B re-capture now shows a second, negative
counterexample, proving the widened domain is genuinely explored. Matrices
regenerated; 2× intent_ok false / 1× true preserved.

## 2026-07-04 14:47 UTC — Phase A initial build (9ca085a)

Repository scaffolded (empty skeleton, then populated per the Phase A
prompt) and pushed to `PayloadGuard-PLG/payloadguard-evidence`:

- `evidence/model.py` (Strength enum, CAVEAT map, dataclasses; Dafny
  false-zero parser note carried for Phase B), `evidence/schema/
  metadata.schema.json` (draft 2020-12, unknown-key rejection,
  crosshair_bounds required), `evidence/render/manual_matrix.py`
  (hand-reviewed binder/renderer).
- `examples/dosage_calculator/`: dose-clamping kernel with PEP316 contracts;
  Sample A (clean, exit 0) and Sample B (broken, exit 1 with concrete
  counterexample) captured by real CrossHair 0.0.107 runs;
  `metadata.yaml` sourced from GIP v1.0 with three requirements;
  matrices generated (not hand-typed) showing intended-PROVEN vs realized-
  BOUNDED_CHECKED mismatches honestly.
- `sources/`: GIP v1.0 hazard analysis archived verbatim + standing rule for
  future source documents. FRN pump-type tag left explicitly unresolved
  after a failed resolution attempt (web search; UPenn pages unreachable).
- Known bounds divergence (declared vs effective CrossHair bounds) flagged,
  not smoothed over. Nothing in the repo asserts PROVEN as realized.
