# KNOWN_LIMITATIONS — gate ledger

Standing rule (Phase B working principle): open questions are resolved at
the gate where they are hit, documented inline; anything not resolvable in
a session is named here with a reason — never silently dropped.

Last updated: 2026-07-07 (Gate 2/C2-C4 WIRING EXTENDED TO VARIANTS A/B:
every schema variant now binds the same real Dafny evidence.
`metadata.a.yaml` declares it in REQ-GIP-1-4-12/REQ-GIP-1-8-1's
`evidence` lists; `metadata.b.yaml` gained `.formal-N` shadow rows
(e.g. `REQ-GIP-1-4-12.formal-1`); `traceability_matrix.formal.json`
(variant C's third partition, built first and confirmed correct before
this extension) is now a full peer in the fact-equality gate, not a
tracked temporary divergence. `intent_ok` is `True` for BOTH requirements
in EVERY variant artifact (A, B, C-symbolic, C-concrete, C-formal) — the
first time since Phase A that `intended_method: "PROVEN"` has been
realized everywhere it's declared, not just in one view. The
fact-equality gate's intent comparison became subset-based (not strict
dict equality) to accommodate `traceability_matrix.formal.json`
permanently lacking an opinion about REQ-DOSE-003 (out of `dosage.dfy`'s
scope by design). The CLI gained `--dafny-captures`, now required to
build variant A/B at all via `evidence.cli`. The temporary
`run_formal_check`/`KNOWN_FORMAL_INTENT_DIVERGENCE` carve-out from the
variant-C-only build is retired — no longer needed. Full detail below).

| Gate | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 2 — CONFLICT rule + binder | **COMPLETE** | `evidence/conflict.py` implements both CONFLICT sub-types (12 tests). `build_matrix()` (`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py`) is the sole implementation across all four variants, running Type 1 internally on every call; Type 2 stays standalone (whole-manifest-set check, not per-variant). `evidence/cli.py` wraps it for any metadata/manifest/concrete-store path. The Step 2 fallback functions (`build_matrix_variant_a/b/c`) and `tests/test_binder_equivalence.py` (which existed solely to check against them) are deleted — git history holds them if ever needed again. Details below. |
| Gate 3 — bounds enforcement via CrossHair API | **DECIDED 2026-07-06: stay-CLI** | Real behavioral test executed (not just a technique writeup) — findings below. |
| Gate 4 — binding authorship | **DECIDED: option 3 (both, cross-checked); Type 1 now implements this for all three metadata shapes, incl. variant C** | Decision and mechanism below. |
| Gate 5 — single-evidence-type fixture for variant C, extended to a third partition | **FULLY RESOLVED (2026-07-06); EXTENDED 2026-07-07** | `tests/test_single_evidence_type.py`: both symbolic-only AND concrete-only in-memory fixtures now appear in exactly one variant-C artifact each. The concrete-only case was impossible until today: `_bind_self_describing` bound a symbolic record to every requirement unconditionally, regardless of what it declared. **Extension (2026-07-07):** the dual-matrix pattern (symbolic/concrete) is now a triple: `traceability_matrix.formal.json`, method-filtered to `dafny`, carries this repository's first-ever real, rendered PROVEN rows. Details below. |
| Gate 6 — FRN pump-type tag | **RESOLVED** | `FRN` = FDA Product Code for "Infusion Pump" (21 CFR 880.5725); within the GIP taxonomy, general-purpose volumetric infusion pumps (peristaltic mechanism, cassette-based administration set), distinct from `All`. Full trail in `sources/README.md`. Well-supported (NotebookLM extraction of the full source PDF, cross-checked against independent FDA-registry research landing on the same code) but not yet independently re-verified against the raw Sec 2.4.1 text — noted, not hidden. |
| Phase C Gate C1 — Dafny adapter | **BUILT 2026-07-07; spec strengthened 2026-07-07 by Gate C4** | Real Dafny 4.11.0 spec for the dosage kernel (`examples/dosage_calculator/dosage.dfy`, verifies clean: `2 verified, 0 errors` — an `ExpectedDose` function plus the method, since Gate C4's fix) plus a deliberately broken variant (`dosage_broken.dfy`, fails for real: `0 verified, 2 errors`, exit 4); a capture runner pair (`run_verify_dafny.py` / `run_verify_dafny_broken.py`) mirroring `run_verify.py`'s discipline, with real committed captures; and `evidence/dafny_adapter.py::parse_dafny_capture`, implementing the false-zero guard via regex on the verifier's own summary line (never a substring match, never bare exit code), refusing on nonzero exit, missing summary line, or nonzero error count. Six tests in `tests/test_dafny_adapter.py`, including a substring-trap regression and a check that `assert_no_realized_proven` still blocks this adapter's PROVEN output from ever reaching a matrix row. REQ-DOSE-003 is explicitly scoped out of the Dafny spec (Dafny `real` has no IEEE overflow concept — confirmed empirically). |
| Phase C Gate C2 — PROVEN exclusivity migration | **BUILT 2026-07-07; wired end-to-end 2026-07-07** | Ruling **R3** (supersedes R2): `assert_no_realized_proven` (`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py`) now permits PROVEN as a realized strength only when a record's `method == "dafny"` AND `verifier_completion_status == "completed"`; every other method — including a record with no method at all — is still hard-blocked, exactly as under R2. 8 new tests in `tests/test_proven_exclusivity.py`: a positive case (a real Dafny PROVEN record, produced the same way Gate C1's adapter produces it, is accepted), explicit negatives for crosshair and concrete_test records forced to claim PROVEN (checked explicitly, not by omission), a missing-method case, two defense-in-depth cases (a `method == "dafny"` record without a completed status is still refused), the row-level-cell shape (variant B/C), and a regression check that all four committed matrix artifacts — none of which contain a dafny record today — still pass unchanged. **Wiring (2026-07-07):** R3's positive branch is no longer only proven correct in isolation — `traceability_matrix.formal.json` is a real artifact where it fires for real, verified by the structural PROVEN sweep in `generate_artifacts.py`. |
| Gate 2 / C2-C4 wiring — real Dafny evidence reaches a live matrix row | **BUILT 2026-07-07 (variant C); EXTENDED 2026-07-07 (variants A/B)** | The first real PROVEN row ever rendered in this repository. Scope ratified with Steven before building (variant C only, then explicitly extended: "go ahead and extend variant A and B now"; Z3 gate inside the binder; metadata declares dafny evidence explicitly). `intent_ok` is `True` for REQ-GIP-1-4-12/REQ-GIP-1-8-1 in EVERY variant artifact now — the temporary A/B divergence tracked when C landed first is closed and its carve-out mechanism retired. See the detailed section below for the full design. |
| Phase C Gate C3 — Dafny output-parsing hardening | **BUILT for vectors 1–3 (2026-07-07); vector 4 BLOCKED, named** | **Vector 1 (vacuous preconditions):** `evidence/dafny_spec_lint.py::check_precondition_satisfiability` extracts a method's `requires` clauses and asks Z3 for real satisfiability, via a small hand-written expression translator (booleans, comparisons incl. chaining, arithmetic, real/int/nat/bool — anything else, e.g. quantifiers, refused outright). Proven against a real committed fixture, `examples/dosage_calculator/vacuous_precondition_probe.dfy`: Dafny itself reports a clean pass (`1 verified, 0 errors`) on a method whose precondition (`x > 0 && x < 0`) can never hold; the checker correctly reports `unsat`. **Vector 2 (weak postconditions, best-effort heuristic, not a proof):** `scan_weak_postconditions` flags `ensures` clauses using a one-way `==>` without a matching `<==>`, tested against a synthetic weak clause (flagged) and both the real dosage.dfy spec and a `<==>` clause (correctly not flagged). **Vector 3 (timeout/resource-limit masking):** real finding on the installed 4.11.0 binary — `dafny verify --resource-limit=1` on the real dosage.dfy spec produces `Dafny program verifier finished with 0 verified, 0 errors, 1 out of resource` — an "errors" count of 0 alongside an incomplete run. Confirmed the real capture's exit_code is 4 (nonzero), so Gate C1's exit-code check already refuses it (an earlier suspicion of an exit-0 false-zero here was a shell-piping artifact in this session's own probing, corrected before being reported as a finding); the summary-line parser in `evidence/dafny_adapter.py` was still hardened to refuse independently on `"out of resource"`/`"out of memory"`/`"timed out"` markers and on more than one summary line in a capture, as defense in depth. **Vector 4 (specification stripping): still BLOCKED, named** — the source material describing this fourth vector was cut off before detail was captured; needs a follow-up read of the original document before it can be scoped at all, not inferred from the name. |
| Phase C interface: `verifier_completion_status` on VerificationResult | **RESOLVED via Gate C1 + C2** | The field exists on `VerificationResult` (`evidence/model.py`), is set by Gate C1's adapter, and is now load-bearing in Gate C2's R3 check — PROVEN requires it to equal `"completed"`, not just a matching method label. Strength-assignment stays adapter-scoped, so PROVEN remains structurally impossible for CrossHair/pytest-backed requirements. |
| Phase C Gate C4 — Spec-Testing Proofs (STPs) | **BUILT 2026-07-07; found and fixed a real spec gap** | IronSpec methodology: prove specific input/output pairs are accepted or rejected by the SPECIFICATION alone, independent of any implementation. Applied to dosage.dfy, an STP lemma revealed the original postcondition (bounds + reverse-flow-zero only) never pinned `dose` to the actual clamped value — a wrong candidate value could not be proven excluded, meaning a broken implementation could have satisfied the spec undetected. **Fixed for real:** `dosage.dfy` gained an `ExpectedDose` function and a pinning `ensures dose == ExpectedDose(...)` clause; re-verified clean (`2 verified, 0 errors`); the real committed capture was re-run honestly (`raw_dafny_output.txt` / `run_manifest_dafny.json` now reflect the fixed spec). The original weak spec is preserved verbatim as `dosage_underconstrained.dfy` (an honesty exhibit, same rationale as `dosage_naive_widening.py`). Two STP suites prove both directions for real: `dosage_stp_suite.dfy` (6 lemmas across the 3 logical branches — normal in-range, ceiling-clamped, reverse-flow — `include`s the fixed spec, all verify: `10 verified, 0 errors`) and `dosage_stp_suite_against_underconstrained.dfy` (the 2 REJECT lemmas for the branches that actually had a gap, `include`s the preserved weak spec, both genuinely fail: `0 verified, 2 errors`, exit 4 — a real negative capture, not smoothed over). 6 new tests in `tests/test_dafny_stp_suite.py`, including a regression on a self-caught mistake (an early REJECT-lemma draft used an out-of-bounds wrong value that the weak spec already excluded trivially, giving a false pass that didn't test the real gap — caught and corrected before committing). Neither STP suite is wired into `build_matrix()` or any generator; matches Gates C1–C3's scope discipline. |
| Phase C Gate C5 — Mutation testing (MutDafny-style) | **BUILT 2026-07-07, extended twice same day (chain/AOR from research, then LVR); 56 mutants, zero survivors, zero unclassifiable** | `evidence/dafny_mutate.py` generates mutants (ROR/LOR/AOR/LVR/COI); `examples/dosage_calculator/run_mutation_suite.py` real-verifies every one against the installed Dafny 4.11.0 binary. History: an initial v1 run (39 mutants, ROR/LOR/AOR/COI) found 2 real survivors (REQ-GIP-1-8-1's `>=` boundary, **fixed** by tightening to `>` on Steven's decision) and 4 unclassifiable results (chain-direction parse errors). External research then produced chain-direction-aware ROR and function-body AOR (42 mutants, zero survivors/unclassifiable) — see the row below for the LVR extension built after that, same day, from its own scoped sub-plan. SOR/HOR remain not implemented, checked not assumed (no set or heap syntax anywhere in the spec, confirmed by test). **Final combined real run across all five operator classes: 56 mutants — 41 killed, 6 filtered_static, 4 filtered_chain_incompatible, 1 filtered_ar_group_incompatible, 4 filtered_magnitude_implied — zero survived, zero unclassifiable.** 33 tests total (`tests/test_dafny_mutate.py`, 25 — fast, pure generation/filter logic, no Dafny invocations; `tests/test_mutation_report.py`, 8 — validates the committed real capture). Full detail below. |
| Phase C Gate C5 LVR extension — Literal Value Replacement | **BUILT 2026-07-07; real run matched every hand-derived prediction exactly, zero survivors** | `evidence/dafny_mutate.py::generate_lvr_mutants` mutates every numeric literal in `dosage.dfy`'s requires/ensures clauses and `ExpectedDose`'s function body — all 7 are exactly `0.0` — to `original ± 0.01` (the clinical-precision floor sourced in the Gate C5 research; the first place that guidance has an actual application). `_lvr_trivial` generalizes ROR's requires/ensures polarity principle from operator-implication to magnitude-implication for LE/LT/GE/GT-adjacent literals (4 filtered as `filtered_magnitude_implied`); EQ-adjacent and all function-body literals have no such filter, sent straight to real verification. Real run: **14 mutants — 10 real-verified, all 10 genuinely killed, zero survivors** — matching the scoping session's hand-worked prediction exactly, site by site (e.g. why widening `concentrationMgPerMl > 0.0` to `> -0.01` fails via `ExpectedDose`'s own unchanged precondition at the pinning clause's call site). 7 new tests. Combined with the rest of Gate C5: **56 mutants total — 41 killed, 6 filtered_static, 4 filtered_chain_incompatible, 1 filtered_ar_group_incompatible, 4 filtered_magnitude_implied — zero survived, zero unclassifiable.** The clinical-precision-floor-vs-exact-zero-requirement tension named in scoping is unresolved — REQ-GIP-1-8-1's function-body zero-literal mutant (site 7) was killed at the ±0.01 granularity, so the tension didn't need resolving to get a clean result here, but the underlying judgment call (is ±0.01 the right test for an exact-zero safety requirement) is still open. Full detail below. |
| Phase C Gate C6 — NL-dialogue confirmation | **BUILT and SIGNED OFF 2026-07-07** | Process-control gate aimed directly at recurrence of Gate 1's original finding: a spec/requirement-text mismatch caught only at review, not at authoring time. `evidence/dafny_nl_summary.py::summarize_method` mechanically extracts each requires/ensures clause verbatim, plus any REQ-ID cited in a trailing comment, alongside a best-effort operator-substitution English gloss labeled as a reading aid, not comprehension — deliberately not a natural-language generator. Only single-line clauses are supported; the function cross-checks its own line-based, comment-preserving extraction against `dafny_spec_lint`'s canonical, already-tested multi-line-capable extractor and refuses (`SystemExit`) on any content mismatch. That refusal check's first draft compared clause counts, not content, and missed a real case — a synthetic multi-line clause produced the same count under both extractors while the line-based scan had silently truncated it, dropping the continuation; caught in manual testing before the test suite was even written, fixed by comparing normalized clause text instead of counts, with a regression test added. 7 tests in `tests/test_dafny_nl_summary.py`. The gate's actual deliverable is not this code but the recorded human decision it feeds: `examples/dosage_calculator/nl_confirmation_dosage_dfy.md` records Steven's sign-off ("it's good for the spec as is") on the generated summary for `dosage.dfy::CalculateHourlyDose`, plus a next-phase item (adapting the spec and explaining downstream analysis by different software, for a regulatory submission) he explicitly scoped out as separate follow-up work, not part of this gate. |
| Gate C6 next-phase adaptation work | **BLOCKED, named 2026-07-07 — asked, not guessed** | Full note in `payloadguard-evidence-roadmap-phaseB-to-C.md`'s "Gate C6 next-phase adaptation work" section. Trigger condition ("a defensible artifact to build it on top of") is now met — the full evidence chain (Gates C1/C4/C5/C6) exists. But the only description of this work anywhere in the repo is one sentence from the original Gate C6 sign-off, repeated verbatim in every place it's mentioned, never elaborated — checked directly (grepped the whole repo, including `PayloadGuard-Evidence-Blueprint-1.md`'s cited FDA guidance URLs), not assumed. Three concrete unknowns block real scoping: what "adapting the spec" means, what "different downstream software" refers to, and which regulatory pathway (510(k)/De Novo/PMA/other) this targets. Matches Gate C3 vector 4's own precedent (stayed BLOCKED, named, rather than inferred from its name alone) — resolved by asking directly rather than guessing a concrete plan from one sentence. |

## Gate 2 — CONFLICT rule: Types 1 and 2 BUILT (2026-07-06)

Blocked since Turn B4: the term appears nowhere in
PayloadGuard-Evidence-Blueprint-1 (0 case-insensitive occurrences,
committed copy in-repo) nor in SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md (a single to-do
mention, not a definition). Per standing rule, semantics were not
inferred from the name — the definition below was drafted against two
candidate test cases from the 2026-07-05 roadmap, refined in discussion
to add a third, and explicitly ratified by Steven before being recorded
here as decided (not just proposed).

### Definition

**Precondition (shared by both sub-types):** CONFLICT is only checked
between two claims that purport to describe **the same thing** — the
same `(requirement_id, scope)` *and* the same underlying verification
act (same tool, same target, same invocation). Two independent evidence
types legitimately bound to one requirement — e.g. REQ-GIP-1-4-12's
`kernel_scope` carrying both a CrossHair capture *and* a concrete test —
are not comparable under this rule; they corroborate, they don't
compete. That shape is normal and stays normal (it's exactly how variant
A's `evidence[]` array is meant to work).

- **Type 1 — Binding-identity conflict (dual-authorship).** Two claims
  about the *same declared binding* disagree on what physical target it
  points to: a top-down, metadata-authored contract says `(file F,
  method M)`; a bottom-up, evidence-store-carried assertion says `(file
  F', method M')`, and F≠F' or M≠M'. This is Gate 4's exact
  cross-check trigger.
- **Type 2 — Evidence-outcome conflict (result inconsistency).** Two
  claims agree on target identity — same tool, same file/method, same
  invocation/bounds — but disagree on what that identical verification
  act produced (one manifest reports exit 0/no counterexample, another
  manifest for the same run reports exit 1/counterexample).

Both types are Tier-1 hard generation failures per Gate 4's decision —
they differ only in which half of the `(identity, outcome)` pair
disagrees. Neither type is triggered by `intent_ok` mismatches
(declared `intended_method` vs. realized strength): that's one binding
compared against its own stated aspiration, not two independent claims
about the same fact, and already has its own mechanism (R1). CONFLICT
must not be reinterpreted to cover it.

### Test cases

1. **Positive, Type 1 (identity mismatch).** Metadata declares REQ-X
   bound to `dosage.py::calculate_hourly_dose`; the evidence-store
   entry for that same binding actually targets
   `dosage_broken.py::calculate_hourly_dose`. Target identity differs →
   **CONFLICT**. This is the original Gate 4/roadmap trigger case.
2. **Negative (GAP, not CONFLICT).** REQ-GIP-1-4-12's `system_scope` has
   zero claims — no evidence exists, rendered as an explicit named GAP.
   The precondition (two claims about the same thing) is never met, for
   either type. **Not a CONFLICT** — this is a documented absence, and
   must keep rendering as a GAP.
3. **Positive, Type 2 (outcome mismatch) — the subfinding this
   refinement was added to cover.** Not a hypothetical abstraction: this
   repository already documents that CrossHair's model-fidelity channel
   is "unreliably sampled and sharply complexity-dependent" (the Sample
   C / overflow-probe honesty exhibits prove the *same* invocation can
   land differently depending on internal solver state). If a future
   re-capture of the identical target/tool/bounds as an already-committed
   manifest ever produced a different exit code — one manifest says
   no-counterexample, a second manifest for the same target says
   counterexample-found — that's Type 2, and nothing catches it today.

### Status

**Type 1 — built (2026-07-06).** `evidence/conflict.py`:
`concrete_binding_conflicts()` cross-checks metadata's top-down concrete
bindings (variant A's per-requirement `evidence` list; variant B's
shadow-pseudo-requirement `implementation`-suffix form) against
`concrete_results.json`'s self-declared `requirement_id`;
`symbolic_binding_conflicts()` cross-checks each requirement's declared
`implementation` file against the crosshair manifest's actual `target`.
`run_conflict_gate()` combines both and raises on any mismatch — Tier 1,
matching the fact-equality and structural-PROVEN gates' behavior. Wired
into `generate_artifacts.py` as stage 3 (runs after capture integrity,
before regeneration), checked against all four metadata files (24
bindings checked on the current committed dataset, 0 conflicts).

**Variant C's asymmetry closed (2026-07-06).** Gate 4 had flagged that C
declared no top-down concrete binding at all, so Type 1 had nothing to
compare there. Per Gate 4 option 3, `metadata.schema.c.json` gained an
optional `evidence` property (identical shape to variant A's) and
`metadata.c.yaml` now declares it on all three requirements, matching the
real bindings already in `concrete_results.json`. This is
cross-checking-only: `build_matrix_variant_c` still never reads
`evidence` — C's actual binding stays evidence-store-carried, unchanged
(confirmed: regenerating C's artifacts after this change produced a
byte-identical diff except `generated_utc`). C now contributes 7 checked
bindings (4 concrete + 3 symbolic) instead of 0.

**Type 2 — built (2026-07-06).** `evidence/conflict.py`:
`outcome_conflicts()` groups manifests by identity (tool, target,
enforced `per_condition_timeout_s` — deliberately excluding the raw
argv, which embeds an environment-specific absolute path, and
`started_utc`, which never matches); any group reporting more than one
distinct `exit_code` is a conflict. `run_outcome_gate()` raises on any
mismatch. Wired into `generate_artifacts.py` as stage 4, run against all
four committed manifests (Sample A, Sample B, the naive-widening exhibit,
the overflow probe): 4 manifests, 4 distinct verification acts, 0
conflicts — a real, honest zero, since each committed manifest targets a
genuinely different file and none collide. `tests/test_conflict_check.py`
covers the real-data clean pass plus two synthetic cases (a positive
mismatch, and a same-outcome-different-target case confirming Type 2
doesn't over-fire on unrelated targets) — matching the established
convention (`test_single_evidence_type.py`) of driving real code with an
in-memory fixture when the committed dataset can't exercise a property.

`tests/test_conflict_check.py` now has 11 tests total, covering all
three ratified test cases across all three metadata shapes plus Type 2.

### Vocabulary-agnostic binder — Step 2 done (2026-07-06): cut over, with an explicit fallback

The remaining piece of Gate 2 — one implementation driving all four
schema-variant shapes, replacing `generate_matrix_a.py` / `_b.py` /
`_c.py` — is a genuine architectural refactor (unlike Types 1/2, which
were additive extensions of an existing pattern), so it's being done in
its own small steps rather than folded into the CONFLICT work above.

**What was built:** `evidence/render/matrix_variants.py` gained
`build_matrix(variant_key, metadata, manifest, concrete_store,
tool_versions=None)` — a single entry point replacing
`build_matrix_variant_a/b/c`. It is a **literal extraction**, not a
reimplementation: every existing variant's record-assembly logic
("binder": `_bind_declared` for A, `_bind_shadow` for B,
`_bind_self_describing` for C) and row-rendering logic ("shape":
`_shape_evidence_array`, `_shape_flattened_shadow`,
`_shape_method_partitioned`) was lifted verbatim into named functions,
dispatched through a declarative table (`_VARIANT_SPECS`) instead of
three separate top-level functions. Binding strategy and row shape are
split as the two real axes of variation, so a future fifth shape can
reuse an existing strategy (or vice versa) instead of requiring a whole
new function.

**Correctness proof:** `tests/test_binder_equivalence.py` (5 tests) runs
both the old function and `build_matrix()` against the identical real
committed inputs for all four variant keys, and asserts equality two
ways — dict equality AND `json.dumps()` string equality (the second
catches key-insertion-order drift that dict `==` alone would miss, which
matters for a future generator cutover producing byte-identical files,
not just equivalent-content ones). All pass.

**Step 2 (2026-07-06): cut over.** Steven approved proceeding with an
explicit request to keep a fallback available. `generate_matrix_a.py` /
`_b.py` / `_c.py` now import and call `build_matrix("a"/"b"/"c-symbolic"/
"c-concrete", ...)` instead of the original per-variant functions.
**Fallback, by design, not an afterthought:** `build_matrix_variant_a/b/c`
are deliberately left in `evidence/render/matrix_variants.py`, fully
intact and unused — if a problem with `build_matrix()` ever surfaces,
each generator's import + call can be reverted to the corresponding
original function in one line, or this cutover commit can be
`git revert`ed outright. They are deleted only in a later, separate
cleanup step once the cutover has proven stable — not bundled into the
cutover itself.

**Verification, not assumption:** the full pipeline was re-run end to
end post-cutover, and every regenerated artifact was diffed against the
pre-cutover committed versions — differs only by `generated_utc`, exactly
as the Step 1 equivalence proof predicted. Full suite: 33 passed
(unchanged from Step 1 — this step changed which function each generator
calls, not any logic).

**Step 3 (2026-07-06): fold CONFLICT Type 1 into build_matrix() itself —
and confirm Type 2 has no per-variant home.** Re-examined the plan
before implementing: Type 1 is inherently per-variant (it's about one
metadata file's declared bindings vs. the evidence store), so it fits
naturally inside `build_matrix()`. Type 2 is NOT per-variant — it
compares raw manifests across the whole dataset regardless of which
variant is being built, so folding it into `build_matrix()` would mean
re-running the identical whole-dataset check on every one of the four
variant calls for no reason. It stays a standalone stage, the same way
the fact-equality gate does (both are properties of the artifact/input
*set*, not of any single generation call).

`build_matrix()` now calls `run_conflict_gate(metadata, concrete_store,
manifest)` as its first step, before assembling any record — Tier 1,
and it runs no matter how `build_matrix()` is invoked (full pipeline, a
single generator script run alone, or a test), closing a real gap: Type
1 previously only ran inside the `generate_artifacts.py` pipeline stage,
so running e.g. `generate_matrix_a.py` alone would have bypassed it
entirely (the individual generators are documented to bypass the
fact-equality gate the same way — Type 1 had the identical exposure
until now).

The frozen base matrix (`metadata.yaml`, via `manual_matrix.py`, ruling
R2c) never calls `build_matrix()`, so it keeps its own explicit check:
`generate_artifacts.py::stage_base_conflict_check` (renamed from the
old, broader `stage_conflict_check`, now scoped to just the base file —
3 symbolic bindings, since base declares no concrete evidence at all).

**Proven, not assumed:** `tests/test_conflict_check.py` gained
`test_build_matrix_folds_in_type1_check`, which drives `build_matrix()`
directly with a conflicting in-memory fixture and confirms it raises
before assembling a single record — proof of the fold-in itself, not
just of the underlying check function. Full pipeline re-run end to end;
every regenerated artifact still differs only by `generated_utc`. Suite:
34 passed (33 prior + 1 new).

**Note on the fallback:** `build_matrix_variant_a/b/c` (Step 2's
fallback) do NOT have Type 1 folded in — only `build_matrix()` does. If
the fallback is ever used in an emergency, Type 1's per-call check is
temporarily lost along with it; that's an accepted, documented tradeoff
of restoring known-good behavior quickly, not a silent regression.

**Still open:** deleting the fallback functions once the cutover has
proven stable (Step 4) — see "What's left for Gate 2" below.

### CLI — built (2026-07-06)

Requested explicitly before Step 4 (deleting the Step 2 fallback), so
the fallback stays available while new capability lands rather than
being removed first.

`evidence/cli.py`: `python -m evidence.cli build --variant {a|b|
c-symbolic|c-concrete} --metadata PATH --manifest PATH --concrete PATH
[--schema PATH] [--out-json PATH] [--out-md PATH]`. This is the
"vocabulary-agnostic" half of Gate 2 made reachable from outside a
Python script: unlike `generate_matrix_a/b/c.py`, which hardcode paths
to `examples/dosage_calculator`, the CLI takes every input as an
argument, so it can build a matrix for a different device's evidence set
matching one of the four schema shapes, not just the worked example.

- Schema validation runs first (`--schema` defaults to
  `evidence/schema/metadata.schema.<a|b|c>.json` for the given
  `--variant`, overridable for a schema that lives elsewhere).
- `tool_versions` is now keyed by the manifest's own declared `tool`
  field (`manifest["tool"]`) rather than a hardcoded `"crosshair"`
  string — a small genuine generalization, since a future Dafny/Z3
  manifest won't need this CLI changed.
- Tier-1 failures (schema validation, CONFLICT Type 1 — folded into
  `build_matrix()` since Step 3) exit non-zero with a short message on
  stderr, not a raw traceback or (for schema errors) jsonschema's full
  schema dump — an actual bug caught and fixed during this build: the
  first version printed the entire JSON Schema on every validation
  failure; fixed to use `ValidationError.message` instead of `str(e)`.
- JSON prints to stdout when `--out-json` is omitted (composes with
  other tools, e.g. `| jq`); markdown is only ever written where
  `--out-md` explicitly says to, never to stdout — an early version
  printed both JSON and markdown to stdout when no output paths were
  given, producing invalid combined output; caught by
  `tests/test_cli.py` and fixed before commit.

**Proven, not assumed:** `tests/test_cli.py` (10 tests) drives the CLI
via subprocess (the way a real user would invoke it) for all four
variants and asserts the output is byte-identical (timestamp aside) to
the corresponding committed artifact, plus covers both clean-exit error
paths and the stdout/file output modes. Full pipeline re-run
independently confirms the CLI's addition changed nothing about the
existing generator scripts. Suite: 44 passed (34 prior + 10 new).

### Step 4 — DONE (2026-07-06): fallback deleted

Requested last, deliberately after the CLI landed. `build_matrix_variant_a`,
`build_matrix_variant_b`, and `build_matrix_variant_c` are deleted from
`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py` — their shared markdown renderers
(`_markdown_variant_a/b/c`) and helpers stayed, since `build_matrix()`
already used those, not the deleted functions. `tests/test_binder_equivalence.py`
is deleted too: its entire purpose was proving old-function output equals
`build_matrix()` output, which is moot once the old functions don't
exist. `tests/test_single_evidence_type.py` (Gate 5's fixture test) was
migrated from calling `build_matrix_variant_c` directly to calling
`build_matrix("c-symbolic"/"c-concrete", ...)` — it's the one other place
in the suite that had called a fallback function directly. The
comments in `generate_matrix_a/b/c.py` and the module-level banner in
`matrix_variants.py` that described the now-gone fallback were updated
to stop referencing it.

**Verified, not assumed:** full suite (39 passed — 44 minus the 5 deleted
equivalence tests), full pipeline re-run (every regenerated artifact
still differs only by `generated_utc`), and the CLI re-checked
independently against a committed artifact post-deletion, all after the
deletion, not just before it. Git history holds the deleted functions
and test if a fallback is ever needed again — that was the entire point
of doing Steps 2-4 in this order rather than deleting immediately.

**Gate 2 is now structurally complete.** The only open item left
anywhere in Gate 2's scope is the CONFLICT rule's own definition, which
is already ratified (see above) — there is no remaining build work.

## Gate 3 — DECIDED 2026-07-06: stay-CLI (crosshair-tool 0.0.107)

Original investigation (2026-07-05) confirmed against the installed
package: `per_condition_timeout` is CLI-enforceable (already enforced
since Turn 2.0 B1); `max_iterations` is not exposed by the CLI but is
exposed by the Python API; `seed` is hard-coded by the tool. A follow-up
roadmap proposed a corrected seed-override technique and a script to test
it behaviorally rather than assume. That script was run for real — three
more errors turned up only by executing it, and the actual result
contradicts the "pending" framing this gate carried before:

**Corrections found by running the script, beyond the roadmap's own
technique fixes (target function `make_default_solver`, hyphenated Z3
param names):**
1. The roadmap's claimed API call, `AnalysisOptions(max_iterations=...,
   per_condition_timeout=...)`, raises `TypeError: missing 9 required
   positional arguments` on the installed 0.0.107 — `AnalysisOptions` has
   no defaults. `analyze_function`'s real second parameter type is
   `AnalysisOptionSet` (the defaultable/partial sibling), confirmed
   against `crosshair/options.py` and `crosshair/core.py`. This matches
   what the original 2026-07-05 investigation already had right.
2. Importing `analyze_function` from bare `crosshair.core` raises
   `CrossHairInternal("Opcode patches haven't been loaded yet.")` the
   moment `.analyze()` is called — the opcode-level tracing patches are
   only installed as a side effect of importing
   `crosshair.core_and_libs`. Must import from there instead.
3. `analyze_function` alone only parses source into `Checkable` objects
   (one per postcondition); it does not run the solver. Each `Checkable`
   needs `.analyze()` called explicitly to execute the real symbolic
   search and yield `AnalysisMessage`s. The uncorrected script silently
   "passed" in under a second by never calling this — a false read that
   would have looked like a completed test.

**Real result, after all corrections, run twice per target
(`CROSSHAIR_SOLVER_SEED=1` vs `=2`):**
- `dosage.py::calculate_hourly_dose` (Sample A, no counterexample either
  way): both seeds returned two `MessageType.CANNOT_CONFIRM` / "Not
  confirmed." messages at the same two lines — byte-identical.
- `dosage_broken.py::calculate_hourly_dose` (has real counterexamples, a
  stronger discriminator): both seeds returned the exact same two
  counterexamples — `calculate_hourly_dose(1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25)` → `0.5`
  and `calculate_hourly_dose(0.5, 0.25, -0.125, 0.125)` → `-0.03125` —
  matching the values already on file in `raw_crosshair_output_broken.txt`
  under the CLI's own hard-coded seed 42.

**Decision:** stay-CLI. The seed-override patch installs without error
but produced no observable behavioral difference on either target
tested; falling back per the pre-agreed criterion. `seed` remains a
documented tool-version limitation — the declared `seed: 1` in
`metadata.yaml` cannot be demonstrated on 0.0.107, and the tool's own
hard-coded seed is 42 (`crosshair/statespace.py`, `make_default_solver()`
— not `StateSpace.__init__` directly, and the real params are hyphenated:
`solver.set("random-seed", 42)`, `solver.set("smt.random-seed", 42)`).
`max_iterations` is confirmed enforceable via the API
(`AnalysisOptionSet`) independent of this decision, should a future
change revisit the CLI-vs-API tradeoff for reasons other than seed.
Verification script committed at
`examples/dosage_calculator/gate3_seed_patch_test.py`; no re-capture
performed — Gate 1's committed captures are untouched.

**Caveat on strength of evidence:** both test targets have simple,
shallow constraint structure; Z3's random-seed parameter mainly affects
tie-breaking in larger search spaces, so "no observed difference" here is
real but not a proof that the parameter can never matter on any target —
only that it didn't move the needle on the two targets this repository
actually uses. Documented as-is, not oversold. (This same non-determinism
concern is what motivates Gate 2's Type 2 CONFLICT test case above.)

Also flagged and closed as a non-issue: CrossHair's latest *tagged*
GitHub release is v0.0.106, while both the toolchain pin and the actually
installed package are 0.0.107 (`pip show crosshair-tool` confirmed
0.0.107 in this environment) — consistent with each other; a PyPI release
can exist ahead of its git tag.

## Gate 4 — decided: option 3, both models cross-checked (mechanism specified 2026-07-05)

Three options were on file; option 3 is now the decision on record:

1. **Metadata-authored everywhere (A/B model):** the binder consumes only
   bindings declared in metadata; C's evidence-store `requirement_id`
   channel is dropped. Pro: single review surface, authorship errors live
   in one place. Con: evidence stores stop being self-describing;
   concrete evidence must be double-entered (in CASES and in metadata).
2. **Evidence-store-carried everywhere (C model):** bindings live with the
   evidence (each record names its requirement). Pro: no duplication;
   evidence is portable. Con: binding errors move into test/capture files
   that regulatory reviewers are less likely to read; metadata no longer
   shows the full evidence picture.
3. **DECIDED — both, with precedence + cross-check:** metadata
   declarations are authoritative where present; store-carried ids are
   validated against them, and a disagreement is a hard generation
   failure (Tier 1). Keeps A/B's review surface and C's portability while
   turning the asymmetry into a consistency check. This is now backed by
   Gate 2's Type 1 CONFLICT definition, so "disagreement" has a concrete,
   ratified meaning rather than an open semantic question.

**Mechanism (dual-authorship cross-check via verified code-location
match), from 2026-07-05 external research:**
- **Top-down contract:** the system/QA-authored master traceability
  config states "REQ-X is verified by the proof/test at file F, method
  M."
- **Bottom-up contract:** the source-embedded assertion (a decorator,
  structured comment, or in Dafny's case an `ensures`/`invariant` clause)
  states "this method verifies REQ-X."
- **Intersection check:** at generation time, extract both, and flag
  non-compliant if the physical file/method/hash doesn't match between
  them — this is Gate 2's Type 1 CONFLICT, exactly.

Design input from Gate 5 work: the original C builder bound a symbolic
record to every requirement by construction and didn't verify the
requirement's `implementation` against the capture manifest's `target`.
**Status: decision, mechanism, and build all done.** The verification
half (Type 1) is built in `evidence/conflict.py`, folded into
`build_matrix()`. The binding half (whether symbolic evidence binds at
all) was fixed as part of closing Gate 5 (below) — `_bind_self_describing`
now consults the same `evidence` declaration Type 1 checks against.

## Gate 5 — single-evidence-type fixture for variant C: FULLY RESOLVED (2026-07-06)

Originally resolved only for the constructible half: a symbolic-only
fixture requirement (no `evidence` list declared) correctly appeared in
exactly one of variant C's two artifacts. A concrete-only fixture was
named as impossible: `_bind_self_describing` bound a symbolic record to
*every* requirement regardless of what it declared, so nothing could
ever be concrete-only.

**Fix:** `_bind_self_describing` (`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py`)
now checks each requirement's declared `evidence` list before binding
symbolic evidence — a requirement declaring only `concrete_test` entries
(no `crosshair` entry) gets no symbolic record. When `evidence` is
absent entirely, the original unconditional behavior is preserved
(backward-compatible with metadata that doesn't use the declaration
style — including the existing symbolic-only fixture, which relies on
exactly this fallback). Concrete binding is untouched either way — it
stays fully self-describing via `concrete_results.json`'s own
`requirement_id` field, per Gate 4's decision for variant C.

**No effect on committed data:** every real requirement in
`metadata.c.yaml` declares a `crosshair` entry (added when Gate 4's
asymmetry was closed), so this changes nothing observable — confirmed
by regenerating and diffing (differs only by `generated_utc`).

**Proven, not assumed:** `tests/test_single_evidence_type.py` now has
two fixtures instead of one: the existing symbolic-only case (unchanged
behavior, still passes) and a new concrete-only case (a requirement
declaring `evidence: [{method: concrete_test, test_id: ...}]`, no
`crosshair` entry) — confirmed to appear in exactly the concrete
artifact and not at all in the symbolic one, the property that was
previously impossible. 4 tests total (2 fixtures × validation + binding
behavior). Suite: 41 passed.

## Gate 6 — FRN pump-type tag: RESOLVED (2026-07-05)

`FRN` = FDA Product Code for "Infusion Pump" (21 CFR 880.5725). Within the
GIP v1.0 taxonomy specifically, denotes general-purpose volumetric
infusion pumps (peristaltic mechanism, cassette-based administration
set), distinct from the `All` tag used elsewhere in the source's hazard
tables. Resolved via NotebookLM's extraction of the full source PDF,
cross-checked against independent FDA-registry research landing on the
same product code — well-supported, but **not yet independently
re-verified against the raw Sec 2.4.1 text** of the source document
itself; that re-verification is named here rather than silently assumed
done. Full trail, citations, and the prior failed resolution attempts are
recorded in `sources/README.md` and
`examples/dosage_calculator/README.md`.

## Phase C Gate C1 — Dafny toolchain (2026-07-06) and adapter build (2026-07-07)

Researched directly rather than settling for the apt package or asking
Steven to make an under-informed call. Every claim below was checked
against the real, running tool, not documentation.

**GitHub is genuinely blocked, confirmed via the proxy itself, not
assumed.** `curl https://github.com` returns 400/403 depending on the
request; the proxy's own status endpoint
(`curl $HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status`) and its README are explicit
that 403/407 from the proxy is an organization egress-policy denial —
"do not retry or route around it." So no GitHub release, mirror, or
workaround was attempted. Two channels already permitted turned out to
be enough:

- `api.nuget.org` → 200 (reachable).
- `dot.net` / `dotnet.microsoft.com` → 301/302 (normal redirects,
  reachable).
- apt has `dotnet-sdk-8.0` directly (Ubuntu's own package, not a
  Microsoft add-on repo) — installed cleanly as 8.0.128 after
  `apt-get update` refreshed a stale package index that had been
  pointing at a version no longer on the mirror.

**Dafny installed via `dotnet tool install --global dafny`** (pulls from
NuGet, the same channel already confirmed reachable) — no GitHub
involvement anywhere in the chain. Result: **Dafny 4.11.0** (full
version string `4.11.0+fcb2042d6d043a2634f0854338c08feeaaaf4ae2`) — a
real, current release, not the ~2015-era `2.3.0+dfsg-0.1` Mono-based
package apt offers directly. That apt package is no longer relevant to
Gate C1 at all.

**Verified against the running binary, three real checks:**
1. **Clean pass:** a valid `Clamp` method (mirrors the dosage kernel's
   clamping shape) verified with output `Dafny program verifier
   finished with 1 verified, 0 errors`, exit code 0 — this is an
   **exact match** to the false-zero note already committed in
   `evidence/model.py`. That note was written from documentation/prior
   knowledge; it's now confirmed accurate against the real 4.11.0
   binary, not just assumed to still hold.
2. **Failure path:** a deliberately broken `Clamp` (returns the raw
   input, unclamped) produced two per-line error blocks plus the
   summary `Dafny program verifier finished with 0 verified, 2 errors`
   — **exit code 4**, not 1. New finding: Dafny's exit codes are not a
   simple 0/success, 1/failure pair the way CrossHair's are — Gate C1's
   capture-integrity check needs `exit_code != 0` (already generically
   correct) but should not assume a specific nonzero value means
   anything beyond "not clean."
3. **The vacuous-precondition vulnerability (Gate C3, vector 1) is real
   on this binary, not speculative:** `requires x > 0 && x < 0` (an
   unsatisfiable precondition) against `ensures r == 999999` with
   `r := 0` in the body verified clean — `1 verified, 0 errors` — even
   though the postcondition is obviously false whenever the method
   could run. Confirms the concern Gate C3 named is a real, reproducible
   false-positive class on the actual tool, not a hypothetical.

**`dafny audit` does not help with vector 1 — checked, not assumed.**
Dafny 4.x ships an `audit` subcommand ("report issues that might limit
the soundness claims of verification"). Ran it against the vacuous
example: `0 findings`. Its help text confirms its actual scope —
un-annotated `assume`/axioms, non-determinism, unverified externs — not
general precondition satisfiability. Gate C3's originally-planned
mitigation (a dedicated Z3 satisfiability check on the extracted
precondition) is still necessary, not optional, and is technically
provable now: `z3.Solver()` correctly reports `unsat` for the
contradictory precondition and `sat` for a real one (e.g.
`0 <= x <= 200`) — confirmed by direct test in this environment.

**Net effect on the Gate C1–C3 plan:** no alteration needed. If
anything the plan is now on firmer ground than when it was written —
the false-zero note holds exactly as documented, the vacuous-precondition
risk is empirically confirmed rather than theoretical, and the Z3-based
mitigation is confirmed feasible with tools already present. The one
concrete addition: capture the exit code as-is (don't assume it's 1 on
failure) and don't rely on `dafny audit` for vector 1.

**Not yet done, as of the toolchain research (2026-07-06):** no capture
runner existed yet, no real Dafny spec had been written for `dosage.py`,
and nothing was committed to the repository from that investigation (the
probe `.dfy` files lived only in the scratch directory).

**Built the following day (2026-07-07), on this same toolchain:**

- `examples/dosage_calculator/dosage.dfy` — a real Dafny method,
  `CalculateHourlyDose`, mirroring the dosage kernel's clamping shape
  (`requires concentrationMgPerMl > 0.0`, `requires maxSafeDoseMgPerHr >
  0.0`, `ensures 0.0 <= dose <= maxSafeDoseMgPerHr`, `ensures
  infusionRateMlPerHr >= 0.0 || dose == 0.0`). Verifies clean against the
  real 4.11.0 binary: `Dafny program verifier finished with 1 verified, 0
  errors`, exit code 0. **REQ-DOSE-003 (finite-result-under-overflow) is
  explicitly excluded from this spec** — confirmed empirically that
  Dafny's `real` type is exact/arbitrary-precision with no IEEE
  overflow/infinity/NaN concept at all (`y := x / 0.0` on a `real` is
  itself a flagged verification error, not a silent `inf`), so there is
  no faithful way to state "finite result under overflow" as a Dafny
  postcondition. Named here as a deliberate scope exclusion, not a silent
  gap. `weight_kg` is also intentionally omitted (it's an unused
  precondition-only guard in the Python original).
- `examples/dosage_calculator/dosage_broken.dfy` — the Sample-B-equivalent
  broken variant (clamp removed). Fails for real against the same binary:
  `Dafny program verifier finished with 0 verified, 2 errors`, **exit
  code 4** (not 1 — confirms the exit-code finding from the toolchain
  research above, now exercised on the actual dosage spec rather than a
  probe).
- `run_verify_dafny.py` / `run_verify_dafny_broken.py` — capture runners
  mirroring `run_verify.py` / `run_verify_broken.py` exactly: subprocess
  the real `dafny verify` command, write the verbatim stdout+stderr and a
  run manifest (tool, tool_version, command, exit_code, started_utc,
  target). Both were run for real, producing genuine committed captures:
  `raw_dafny_output.txt`, `run_manifest_dafny.json`,
  `raw_dafny_output_broken.txt`, `run_manifest_dafny_broken.json` — no
  fabricated output anywhere.
- `evidence/dafny_adapter.py::parse_dafny_capture(raw_output, manifest)`
  — the false-zero guard itself. Checks, in order: (1) `exit_code != 0`
  → refuse, cheapest and most definitive signal, checked first; (2) no
  regex match for `Dafny program verifier finished with (\d+) verified,
  (\d+) errors?` anywhere in the output → refuse (a crash, a timeout, or
  a Dafny subcommand that "did not attempt verification" — confirmed
  real behavior of `dafny audit` on some inputs — must not be silently
  treated as success just because exit_code happens to be 0); (3) parsed
  error count != 0 → refuse. Only when all three pass does it construct a
  `VerificationResult(strength=Strength.PROVEN, verifier_completion_status="completed", ...)`.
  Never a blind `"0 errors" in raw_output` substring check, which a
  printed error message could coincidentally contain.
- `evidence/model.py` gained `verifier_completion_status: Optional[str] =
  None` on `VerificationResult` — purely additive, doesn't disturb any
  existing construction site.
- `tests/test_dafny_adapter.py` — six tests, all passing: parses the real
  committed clean capture to PROVEN; refuses the real committed broken
  capture (on `exit_code=4`, before the summary line is ever parsed);
  refuses a synthetic nonzero-exit manifest; refuses a synthetic
  missing-summary-line capture (mimicking `dafny audit`'s "did not
  attempt verification"); and the load-bearing regression —
  **`test_false_zero_guard_is_not_fooled_by_a_substring_trap`** —
  constructs raw output containing the literal substring `"0 errors"` in
  an unrelated sentence *plus* a real summary line reporting `3 verified,
  2 errors`, and confirms the parser correctly refuses (a blind substring
  check would have wrongly passed this exact input). A sixth test,
  **`test_producing_a_proven_result_does_not_reopen_the_matrix_gate`**,
  builds a fake matrix row using this adapter's real `Strength.PROVEN`
  value and confirms `assert_no_realized_proven`
  (`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py`) still hard-blocks it — proving
  this adapter cannot itself reopen the PROVEN-exclusivity boundary; only
  Gate C2 (still unbuilt) could do that.
- **Explicitly not done here, and not this module's job:** `dafny_adapter.py`
  is not called from `build_matrix()`, any `generate_matrix_*.py` script,
  or the CLI. Wiring a Dafny-sourced PROVEN result into the matrix
  pipeline — including deciding how `verifier_completion_status`
  surfaces in a rendered row — is Gate C2's job by name (the
  PROVEN-exclusivity migration), not an incidental side effect of this
  build.

**Made reproducible for future sessions (2026-07-06):** the toolchain
research above only holds for this session's container — a fresh
session starts from a clean clone with none of it installed. Added
`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` (registered via `.claude/settings.json`)
to install it automatically: Python deps (`crosshair-tool`, `jsonschema`,
`pyyaml`, `pytest`), the .NET 8 SDK via apt, and **Dafny pinned to
4.11.0** via `dotnet tool install --global dafny --version 4.11.0` —
pinned explicitly, matching the `crosshair-tool 0.0.107` discipline, so
a future session doesn't silently pick up a different Dafny version
with different output conventions than the ones verified above. The
hook is idempotent (checked installed versions before reinstalling) and
runs synchronously (session start waits for it, trading startup latency
for guaranteeing the toolchain is ready before any command runs).
Validated by running it directly in this session (exit 0, ~1.4s on the
already-provisioned path) and confirming `dafny --version` and the full
test suite (41 passed) both work immediately after.

## Phase C Gate C2 — PROVEN's exclusivity migration: BUILT (2026-07-07)

Requested directly: "start gate C2." The roadmap's design for this gate
was already fully specified (`payloadguard-evidence-roadmap-phaseB-to-C.md`,
Gate C2 section) before this build — this session implemented that
ratified design rather than inventing a new one.

**The rule (ruling R3, supersedes R2):** `assert_no_realized_proven`
(`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py`) previously hard-failed if ANY
record anywhere claimed PROVEN, full stop, no exceptions. It now permits
PROVEN as a realized strength under exactly one condition: the record's
`method` field equals `"dafny"` **and** its `verifier_completion_status`
field equals `"completed"`. Both conditions are required — a record
naming `method="dafny"` alone is not enough; a hand-assembled or
corrupted record that skipped the adapter's own checks is still refused.
Every other method — `crosshair`, `concrete_test`, or a row/record with
no method at all (e.g. a scope-GAP row) — remains permanently,
unconditionally excluded from PROVEN, exactly as under R2.

**Why the completion-status check is real defense-in-depth, not
redundant paranoia:** `evidence/dafny_adapter.py::parse_dafny_capture` is
already structurally incapable of returning a PROVEN
`VerificationResult` unless its own exit-code, summary-line, and
false-zero checks all passed — so in the adapter's own output, `method
== "dafny"` and `verifier_completion_status == "completed"` are always
both true together. R3 re-checks both anyway, at the matrix boundary,
because `assert_no_realized_proven` has no way to know whether a future
binder assembled a given record through the adapter or by hand; the
check must hold regardless of how the record got there, not just for
today's one call site.

**8 new tests, `tests/test_proven_exclusivity.py`** — the roadmap named
two required cases (a positive and a negative); this build has both plus
additional defense-in-depth and shape coverage:
1. **Positive:** a real Dafny PROVEN record, produced via
   `parse_dafny_capture` against the real committed clean capture (the
   same one Gate C1 verified), is accepted by `assert_no_realized_proven`
   without raising.
2. **Negative, crosshair:** a `method="crosshair"` record with
   `strength="PROVEN"` and a completed status is refused — checked
   explicitly with a real fixture, not inferred from the absence of a
   binder that would produce one.
3. **Negative, concrete_test:** same property, the other permanently-
   excluded method.
4. **Negative, missing method:** a record with no `method` key at all
   (mirrors a scope-GAP row's actual shape) is refused, not silently
   accepted because there's nothing to compare against `"dafny"`.
5. **Negative, dafny method without completed status:** a record naming
   `method="dafny"` but `verifier_completion_status=None` is still
   refused — the method label alone is not trusted.
6. **Negative, dafny method with an explicit incomplete status:** same
   property with a non-`None`, non-`"completed"` value.
7. **Row-level shape:** variant B/C's rows carry `strength`/`method`
   directly on the row (not nested in an `evidence` list) — confirmed
   the same rule applies to that shape too.
8. **Regression:** all four committed matrix artifacts (none of which
   contain a dafny record today) still pass `assert_no_realized_proven`
   unchanged — R3 does not alter behavior for the live, all-CrossHair/
   concrete-test dataset.

**Existing structural tests unaffected, verified not assumed:**
`tests/test_structural_proven_check.py`'s corruption cases (a
`crosshair`-method record forced to `PROVEN`) still raise under R3 with
the identical error-message substring (`"realized strength PROVEN"`) —
its assertions needed no changes, confirming R3 is a strict relaxation
for one specific, checked case rather than a broadening of the rule in
general. Full suite re-run after this build: 55 passed (47 prior + 8
new). The full `generate_artifacts.py` pipeline was also re-run,
producing zero observable change to any committed matrix artifact beyond
`generated_utc` timestamps — confirming R3 has no effect on the live
pipeline today, since no binder yet produces a dafny-method record.

**Explicitly not done here, and not this gate's job:** no binder in
`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py` (`_bind_declared`, `_bind_shadow`,
`_bind_self_describing`) was changed to actually assemble a Dafny-sourced
record into a live matrix row. R3 makes that *possible* without
violating the structural gate; it does not make it *happen*. Per the
roadmap's own suggested build order, wiring a real Dafny record into the
matrix pipeline belongs alongside Gate C4 (Spec-Testing Proofs,
"alongside the first real spec"), and trusting a live PROVEN claim in
earnest still waits on Gate C3's parser hardening. Gate C2's job was
narrowly the structural rule change — done.

## Phase C Gate C3 — Dafny output-parsing hardening: vectors 1–3 BUILT, vector 4 BLOCKED (2026-07-07)

Requested directly: "start gate c3." The roadmap named four distinct
failure modes; this build addresses the three that were actually
scopeable and leaves the fourth named rather than guessed at.

### Vector 1 — vacuous proofs from contradictory preconditions: BUILT

A `requires` clause that can never be true makes every postcondition
hold vacuously — Dafny reports a clean pass with no hint anything is
wrong. `evidence/dafny_spec_lint.py::check_precondition_satisfiability`
extracts a method's `requires` clauses (via `_find_method_header` /
`extract_requires_clauses`, a small header-scanning routine that tracks
paren depth to find the body's opening brace, then splits on clause
keywords) and asks Z3 whether their conjunction is satisfiable —
independent of whatever Dafny itself reported.

A small, explicitly-scoped hand-written expression translator
(`_tokenize` + the `_Parser` recursive-descent class) handles exactly
the subset of Dafny expressions this repo's specs actually use:
`&&`/`||`/`!`/`==>`/`<==>`, chained comparisons (`0.0 <= dose <=
maxSafeDoseMgPerHr`), arithmetic, and `real`/`int`/`nat`/`bool`
identifiers and literals. `nat` parameters get their implicit `>= 0`
Dafny semantics as an added constraint (checked: `requires n < 0` on a
`nat` parameter is correctly `unsat`). Anything outside that subset —
quantifiers (`forall`/`exists`), `old(...)`, unknown parameter types
(e.g. `array2<int>`), unparseable trailing tokens — raises `SystemExit`
outright, Tier 1: refused, never mistranslated or silently dropped.

**Proven against a real committed fixture, not a synthetic string only:**
`examples/dosage_calculator/vacuous_precondition_probe.dfy` — a tiny,
dedicated, committed Dafny file with `requires x > 0 && x < 0` and
`ensures r == 999999`. Verified for real against Dafny 4.11.0: **`1
verified, 0 errors`, exit 0 — a genuine clean pass** on a method whose
postcondition is obviously unreachable-but-unfalsifiable. The Z3 checker
correctly reports `unsat` on the same method's extracted precondition —
catching, mechanically, exactly what the verifier's own clean-pass
report missed. A true-negative companion check confirms the real
dosage.dfy kernel's actual precondition (`concentrationMgPerMl > 0.0 &&
maxSafeDoseMgPerHr > 0.0`) is correctly reported `sat` — the checker
doesn't cry wolf on a legitimate spec.

### Vector 2 — weak postconditions: BUILT (heuristic, best-effort, named as such)

A one-way implication (`==>`) in an `ensures` clause can let a broken
implementation vacuously satisfy the spec whenever the antecedent is
false, where a bi-implication (`<==>`) would have pinned down both
directions. `evidence/dafny_spec_lint.py::scan_weak_postconditions`
flags every `ensures` clause containing `==>` without also containing
`<==>`, returning warning strings for human review — **not a hard
block and not a full proof**, exactly as the roadmap scoped it: this
heuristic cannot and does not decide whether a bi-implication was
actually *needed* for a given spec, only that a one-way implication is
present and worth a second look.

Tested against the real dosage.dfy kernel (zero warnings — its ensures
clauses use `<=`/`==`/`||`, never `==>`, a true negative), a synthetic
one-way-implication clause (`ensures valid ==> r2 == r`, flagged with
the clause text quoted verbatim), and a synthetic `<==>` clause (not
flagged, another true negative).

### Vector 3 — timeout/resource-limit masking: BUILT, with a real empirical finding

**A genuine finding on the installed Dafny 4.11.0 binary, not a
hypothetical:** `dafny verify --resource-limit=1` on the real,
committed `dosage.dfy` spec produces

    Dafny program verifier finished with 0 verified, 0 errors, 1 out of resource

— an `"errors"` count of **0** on a run that did **not** complete.
Committed for real via a new capture runner,
`run_verify_dafny_resource_limited.py`, producing genuine
`raw_dafny_output_resource_limited.txt` /
`run_manifest_dafny_resource_limited.json` (no fabricated output).

**Checked, not assumed, whether this is actually exploitable via
exit_code alone:** the real captured `exit_code` is **4** (nonzero), so
Gate C1's existing `exit_code != 0` check already refuses this capture
before the summary line is ever parsed — this vector does *not* silently
bypass exit-code protection in this Dafny version. (An earlier
suspicion in this same session that the exit code was 0 for this case
turned out to be a shell-scripting artifact — a piped command whose
`$?` was `tail`'s exit status, not `dafny`'s — caught and corrected by
re-running the check without the pipe, in the same "verify, don't
assume" spirit this repo applies to the tool itself, applied here to my
own probing too.)

**Hardened anyway, as real defense in depth, not just because the risk
is proven live today:** `evidence/dafny_adapter.py`'s summary-line
regex now captures the tail of the summary line after the error count
and refuses if it contains `"out of resource"`, `"out of memory"`, or
`"timed out"` (case-insensitive) — independent of the exit-code check,
so the false-zero guard doesn't rely on exit-code correctness alone. Of
these three markers, only `"out of resource"` was independently
reproduced end-to-end against the real binary this session; `"out of
memory"` and `"timed out"` are the confirmed sibling vocabulary in the
same Boogie/Dafny summary-formatting code path (verified by extracting
UTF-16 string literals directly from the installed `Boogie.
ExecutionEngine.dll` / `DafnyDriver.dll` — `", {0} out of memory"`, `",
{0} out of resource"`, `"timed out"` all appear as parallel fragments)
but were not independently forced to reproduce in this session — named
as such, not overclaimed as separately verified.

Also hardened: the parser now refuses if a capture contains **more than
one** summary-line match, rather than trusting `.search()`'s first
match — checked empirically that a normal `dafny verify` invocation
with multiple target files still emits exactly one aggregate summary
line, so this closes a theoretical ambiguity without changing behavior
for any real single-target capture in this repo.

**8 new tests, `tests/test_dafny_timeout_masking.py`:** the real
resource-limited capture is refused (via the exit-code check); synthetic
cases prove the summary-line hardening fires independently for all
three markers even with a forced `exit_code: 0`; an ambiguous
two-summary-line capture is refused; and the real Gate C1 clean capture
still parses to PROVEN unchanged (no regression on the happy path).

### Vector 4 — specification stripping: still BLOCKED, named

No new source material surfaced this session either. The fourth vector
referenced an LLM-self-healing-loop scenario in the original planning
document, cut off before detail was captured. Still needs a follow-up
read of that original document before it can be scoped at all — not
inferred from the name, not guessed at, exactly as it was left after
Gate C1/C2.

**Test count:** 11 new tests in `tests/test_dafny_spec_lint.py` (vectors
1–2) plus 6 in `tests/test_dafny_timeout_masking.py` (vector 3) — full
suite now 72 passed (55 prior + 17 new). Full `generate_artifacts.py`
pipeline re-run: zero observable change beyond `generated_utc`
timestamps — none of this gate's mechanisms are wired into
`build_matrix()` or any generator; they're standalone, tested
capabilities, exactly matching Gate C1's own scope.

**Explicitly not done here:** neither the Z3 precondition check nor the
weak-postcondition heuristic is invoked automatically anywhere in the
capture or generation pipeline — they exist as tested, callable modules,
not as a gate that runs on every capture. Wiring them into the capture
workflow (so every future Dafny spec gets both checks run against it as
a matter of course) is a natural follow-up but wasn't asked for and
isn't implied by "start gate C3" — named here rather than silently
assumed done.

## Phase C Gate C4 — Spec-Testing Proofs (STPs): BUILT, and found a real spec gap (2026-07-07)

Requested directly: "start gate C4." IronSpec's methodology — prove
that specific, manually chosen input/output pairs are correctly accepted
or rejected *by the specification itself*, independent of whether any
implementation is ever called — was applied to the one Dafny spec that
exists in this repo, `dosage.dfy` (Gate C1). It found a real gap on the
first attempt, not a synthetic one built to demonstrate the mechanism.

### The finding: the original postcondition never pinned the dose value

Before this gate, `CalculateHourlyDose`'s ensures clauses were exactly
two: `0.0 <= dose <= maxSafeDoseMgPerHr` (bounds) and
`infusionRateMlPerHr >= 0.0 || dose == 0.0` (reverse-flow-zero). Neither
clause relates `dose` to the actual product of rate and concentration in
the normal or ceiling-clamped cases. Checked directly, not assumed: a
Dafny lemma stating "if these inputs are fixed and `dose` satisfies both
ensures clauses, then `dose` must equal the one correct clamped value"
**failed to verify** — Dafny could not prove it, because the postcondition
genuinely does not force it. A method that always returned `0.0` for any
non-negative-rate input would have satisfied the exact same spec Gate C1
verified as a clean pass. This is the identical bug CLASS Gate 1 found by
hand for REQ-GIP-1-4-12 (spec/evidence not matching the requirement
text) — recurring, independently, in this session's own new Dafny spec,
caught mechanically this time rather than by manual review.

### The fix

`examples/dosage_calculator/dosage.dfy` gained a `function ExpectedDose(
concentrationMgPerMl, infusionRateMlPerHr, maxSafeDoseMgPerHr): real`
computing the exact clamped value (same three-way branch as the method
body), and a new `ensures dose == ExpectedDose(...)` clause pinning the
method's output to it exactly. The two original ensures clauses stay,
unchanged, for direct per-requirement traceability (REQ-GIP-1-4-12,
REQ-GIP-1-8-1) — now implied by, not contradicting, the pinning clause.
Re-verified for real: `2 verified, 0 errors` (the function plus the
method), exit 0. **The real committed capture was re-run honestly, not
patched:** `raw_dafny_output.txt` / `run_manifest_dafny.json` now reflect
this fixed spec (previously `1 verified, 0 errors` for the method alone).
`tests/test_dafny_adapter.py`'s assertion on the exact `raw_status`
string was updated to match, with a comment explaining why the count
changed.

### The preserved exhibit and the two-sided proof

`examples/dosage_calculator/dosage_underconstrained.dfy` preserves the
ORIGINAL weak spec byte-for-byte — same rationale as
`dosage_naive_widening.py`: a defect that "looks fine" (verifies cleanly
on its own — confirmed for real, `1 verified, 0 errors`) is kept, named,
rather than quietly replaced with no trace. Two STP suites prove the gap
existed and is now closed, both `include`-ing the relevant spec rather
than duplicating it:

- **`dosage_stp_suite.dfy`** (`include "dosage.dfy"`, the fixed spec):
  six lemmas across the three logically distinct branches of
  `CalculateHourlyDose` — normal in-range, ceiling-clamped, and
  reverse-flow. Each of the first two gets one ACCEPT lemma (the correct
  value is provably forced) and one REJECT lemma (a wrong candidate
  value is provably excluded — `ensures false` proved from a
  contradiction). The reverse-flow branch gets only an ACCEPT lemma; it
  was never a gap, even in the weak spec (see below). All six verify
  cleanly against the fixed spec: `10 verified, 0 errors`, exit 0.
- **`dosage_stp_suite_against_underconstrained.dfy`** (`include
  "dosage_underconstrained.dfy"`, the preserved original): the *same two*
  REJECT lemmas, run against the weak spec instead. Both **fail to
  verify** — `0 verified, 2 errors`, exit 4 — a genuinely negative
  capture, not smoothed over, mirroring `dosage_broken.dfy`'s honesty
  discipline. This is the mechanized proof that the gap was real: the
  identical lemma that succeeds against the fix cannot be proved against
  the original.
- **Why the reverse-flow branch has no REJECT lemma against the weak
  spec:** `infusionRateMlPerHr >= 0.0 || dose == 0.0` already forces
  `dose` to exactly `0` whenever the rate is negative — that branch was
  never under-constrained, checked rather than assumed identical to the
  other two.

### A mistake caught during this build, corrected before committing

An early draft of the ceiling-clamped REJECT lemma used `dose == 500.0`
(the raw, unclamped product) as the "wrong" value. That lemma verified
even against the **weak** spec — not because the weak spec pins the
correct value, but because `500.0` already violates the weak spec's own
`0.0 <= dose <= maxSafeDoseMgPerHr` bound directly, so excluding it
proves nothing about the actual gap (whether the spec forces the
*correct in-bounds* value, `100.0`, rather than some other in-bounds
value). Caught by checking the lemma's behavior against the weak spec
directly rather than assuming the chosen wrong-value was a good test;
corrected to `dose == 50.0` (in-bounds, still wrong) in both suites,
re-verified, and a regression test
(`test_reject_lemmas_target_in_bounds_wrong_values_not_out_of_bounds_ones`)
added to `tests/test_dafny_stp_suite.py` to guard against silently
reintroducing the weaker, false-passing value.

### Tests and verification

`tests/test_dafny_stp_suite.py` — 6 tests, checking the real committed
captures directly (not via `evidence.dafny_adapter.parse_dafny_capture`,
since an STP suite's capture is a proof about the spec's tightness, not
itself a requirement's verification evidence — matching Gate C1–C3's
precedent of standalone, non-wired capabilities): the underconstrained
spec still verifies alone; the STP suite passes against the fix; the
same suite fails against the preserved weak spec; the 50.0-vs-500.0
regression; and two direct source-text checks confirming the fixed spec
has the pinning clause and the preserved exhibit does not. Full suite
after this gate: **78 passed** (72 prior + 6 new). Full
`generate_artifacts.py` pipeline re-run: zero observable change beyond
`generated_utc` timestamps.

**Explicitly not done here:** neither STP suite is wired into
`build_matrix()` or any generator, and no automated mechanism runs STPs
against future Dafny specs as a matter of course — this gate authored
one STP suite for the one spec that exists, per its stated scope ("every
Dafny spec written for Phase C gets a small STP suite alongside it,
authored by whoever writes the spec"), not a generic STP-generation
tool.

## Phase C Gate C5 — Mutation testing: BUILT, extended from research findings, zero survivors/unclassifiable (2026-07-07)

Requested directly: "build it and be careful with Dafny. just. we can
consider floating points later..it's a known but solvable issue" —
following up on the scoping session earlier the same day. Read as: build
the core (ROR/LOR/COI on requires/ensures clauses) now; the
floating-point-adjacent risk named in the scoping doc (AOR's `/` mutant
possibly failing via Dafny's own division-by-zero check rather than the
postcondition) can wait. A later message added: "we can consider
bounding floating points within the terms of accuracy... if we're
dealing with an integer 1e10, we don't have to be any more accurate than
accuracy requires" — recorded here as guidance for that follow-up (bound
any future real-valued mutant to the accuracy the dosage calculation
actually needs, not to Dafny's unbounded exact-`real` precision), not
acted on in this build.

### What was built

`evidence/dafny_mutate.py`: `generate_ror_mutants`/`generate_lor_mutants`/
`generate_aor_mutants`/`generate_coi_mutants` (+ `generate_mutants`,
aggregating all four). Reuses `dafny_nl_summary._CLAUSE_LINE_RE` (the
single-line clause convention Gate C6 established) and
`dafny_spec_lint._find_method_header` to locate clause spans; a local,
span-preserving tokenizer extends `dafny_spec_lint`'s token grammar with
one addition (a COMMA token, so a clause containing a function call like
the pinning clause's `ExpectedDose(a, b, c)` can be lexically scanned) -
safe here specifically because mutation only ever relocates an
operator's TEXT, it never needs to understand what the expression means
the way Z3 translation does, so tolerating syntax the Z3 translator
correctly refuses does not risk mistranslating anything.

**Pass 1 (static triviality filter), the design point worth stating
explicitly:** a mutant is skipped before spending a real Dafny
invocation on it when it's guaranteed uninteresting from a fixed,
context-free relational-operator implication table alone — but the
DIRECTION that's "trivial" flips by clause role, and getting this
backwards would have silently filtered out the informative mutants
instead of the uninteresting ones:
- For an **ensures** clause, weakening is trivial: if the original
  clause `P` already provably holds, and the mutant `P'` is a universal
  logical consequence of `P` (e.g. `==` weakened to `<=`), then `P'`
  trivially still holds — no new verification needed, and testing it
  would tell you nothing.
- For a **requires** clause, *strengthening* is trivial: if a mutant `Q'`
  is a universal logical consequence that makes the precondition
  *narrower* (e.g. `>=` tightened to `>`), then the original proof
  (which worked under the wider hypothesis `Q`) still trivially applies
  under `Q'` — testing it would also tell you nothing. The informative
  direction for a requires clause is *weakening* it (admitting states the
  original proof never had to handle).

Verified against a synthetic spec independent of `dosage.dfy`'s specific
content (`test_ror_polarity_flips_between_requires_and_ensures`), not
just against the one real spec, since this is the least obvious part of
the design and the one most likely to be silently wrong in one direction
without a targeted test.

**Passes 2-3, reuse over reinvention, as scoped:** pass 2 (vacuity
filtering for `requires` mutants) calls `dafny_spec_lint.check_precondition_satisfiability`
directly against the mutated full source — no new Z3 code. Pass 3
(re-verification) is `examples/dosage_calculator/run_mutation_suite.py`,
mirroring `run_verify_dafny.py`'s capture discipline (real subprocess,
verbatim output, real exit code) and reusing `dafny_adapter`'s
`_SUMMARY_RE`/`_INCOMPLETE_MARKERS` for the same never-trust-a-bare-exit-
code parsing rigor, per-mutant.

### Real run against `dosage.dfy::CalculateHourlyDose`: 39 mutants

29 killed, 4 filtered_static (pass 1), **2 survived**, **4 unclassifiable**.
Mutant `.dfy` files are not committed individually (mechanically derived,
one text substitution — unlike the STP suites' hand-authored artifacts);
what's committed is the generator, the runner, and the real per-mutant
outcome: `examples/dosage_calculator/mutation_report.json`/`.md` and
`run_manifest_mutation.json`.

**The 2 survivors — a real, understood finding, reported then fixed on
Steven's decision, not silently changed.** Both were
`infusionRateMlPerHr >= 0.0 || dose == 0.0` (REQ-GIP-1-8-1) with the
first disjunct's `>=` mutated to `!=` or `>`; both still verified
(`2 verified, 0 errors`), confirmed by direct re-run, not a fluke. Root
cause, worked out by hand and checked against the real numbers: at
`infusionRateMlPerHr == 0.0` exactly, real multiplication gives
`rawDose == 0.0 * concentrationMgPerMl == 0.0` exactly, which is neither
`< 0.0` nor `> maxSafeDoseMgPerHr` (since `maxSafeDoseMgPerHr > 0.0` by
precondition), so `dose == rawDose == 0.0` — meaning the clause's second
disjunct (`dose == 0.0`) already holds at that single boundary point
regardless of which comparison operator the first disjunct uses. The
postcondition's `>=` at that exact point wasn't independently load-
bearing given how the implementation clamps.

**Not silently changed — reported first, fixed on explicit decision:**
`dosage.dfy` is the spec Steven signed off on in Gate C6 ("it's good for
the spec as is") the same day, so this finding was reported for his
decision rather than acted on unilaterally. **Decision: "go ahead and
tighten REQ-GIP-1-8-1 to `>`."** `dosage.dfy` changed accordingly,
re-verified clean (`2 verified, 0 errors`, unchanged — the tightening
didn't cost anything), and the mutation suite re-run in full to confirm
the fix rather than just asserting it: **zero survivors remain.** The
two former survivor mutations (`> -> >=`, `> -> !=`) are now correctly
recognized by pass 1's static filter as trivially uninteresting *before*
Dafny is even invoked — a proof of `x > 0` universally implies both
`x >= 0` and `x != 0` — which is itself a clean, mechanical confirmation
that the boundary is now tight (filtered_static rose from 4 to 6; killed
stayed exactly 29; unclassifiable stayed exactly 4 and is unrelated).
`examples/dosage_calculator/nl_confirmation_dosage_dfy.md` gained an
amendment recording the decision, the regenerated plain-English summary,
and the re-confirmation. `dosage.dfy`'s header comment documents the fix
inline, alongside the Gate C4 fix comment it sits next to.

**The 4 unclassifiable results — a real gap in the mutation engine, not
in the spec.** All 4 come from mutating exactly one side of the chained
`0.0 <= dose <= maxSafeDoseMgPerHr` clause to a descending operator
(`>=` or `>`) while leaving the other `<=` unchanged, e.g.
`0.0 >= dose <= maxSafeDoseMgPerHr`. Confirmed by direct re-run: Dafny's
own PARSER rejects this (`this operator chain cannot continue with an
ascending/descending operator`, exit code 2) — a real Dafny language
rule (chained comparisons must stay direction-consistent) that the
mutation engine doesn't yet model. Correctly refused rather than
misclassified: `run_mutation_suite.py._classify` only accepts exit codes
0/4 as classifiable results, and relays Dafny's own error line (with the
generated temp filename scrubbed for determinism) as the detail rather
than guessing. **Not fixed in this pass** — a real, scoped follow-up
(teach the generator Dafny's chain-direction compatibility rule, or skip
generating direction-incompatible chain mutants) would remove this
category; named here rather than left unexplained.

### Explicitly out of v1 scope, checked not assumed

**SOR/HOR:** not implemented at all. `test_sor_and_hor_not_applicable_confirmed_by_absence_of_syntax`
greps `dosage.dfy` for set-typed syntax (`set<`, `iset<`, `multiset<`,
`seq<`) and heap/object-state syntax (`old(`, `fresh(`, `allocated(`,
`reads `, `modifies `) and asserts none are present — "not applicable"
is a tested fact about this spec, not an assumption.

**AOR:** implemented and exercised (`generate_aor_mutants` runs against
the real spec and is asserted to return `[]`, not just left untested) —
but the one arithmetic operator in `dosage.dfy`
(`infusionRateMlPerHr * concentrationMgPerMl`) lives inside
`ExpectedDose`'s function body, outside this v1's clause-level mutation
scope, so it correctly contributes zero mutants today. Mutating it would
need a separate function-body extractor (not built) and would revive the
named division-by-zero attribution risk from the scoping session, plus
the newer guidance to bound any real-valued mutant to the dosage
calculation's actual required accuracy rather than Dafny's unbounded
exact-`real` precision — both deferred together as one follow-up, not
solved piecemeal here.

### Tests

`tests/test_dafny_mutate.py` (11 tests) — pure generation/filter logic,
no Dafny invocations, fast: real-spec ROR/LOR/AOR/COI counts and
filtering (updated post-fix: 6 filtered, not 4); the SOR/HOR
non-applicability check; a byte-level check that a mutation changes
exactly the targeted operator and nothing else; the requires/ensures
polarity-flip test described above; tokenizer function-call and
unknown-syntax handling. `tests/test_mutation_report.py` (5 tests) —
validates the COMMITTED real capture rather than re-running 39 Dafny
invocations on every test pass (matches this repo's established pattern
for other real captures): total/outcome counts (0 survivors, post-fix),
a regression confirming the two former survivor mutations are now
`filtered_static` (so a future regeneration can't let a survivor
quietly reappear without a test failing), the four unclassifiable
entries all attributed to the chain-direction parse error, and that no
recorded mutant ever touches the method's own implementation body. Full
suite after this gate: **121 passed** (105 prior + 16 new).

### Research findings and a correction (2026-07-07)

External research into the two open questions this gate's build raised
(sent out via `gate-c5-research-prompt.md`, results recorded in full in
`examples/dosage_calculator/gate_c5_mutation_testing_research_findings.md`)
produced one correction worth stating plainly: **this gate's own label,
"MutDafny/IronSpec-style," was wrong.** IronSpec's actual mutation
technique is a directional, implication-lemma-based approach, distinct
from what this module does (brute verify/observe, matching MutDafny).
Corrected in `evidence/dafny_mutate.py`'s module docstring and
throughout this repo's docs; Gate C4's own IronSpec attribution (STPs)
is unaffected and correct. The research also gave the Problem-A survivor
finding a name with real precedent — **masking**, the MC/DC term for a
sibling condition making a boundary's exact operator unobservable,
FAA/DO-178C-accepted in the adjacent aerospace safety-critical field.

### Extension, same day: chain-direction-aware ROR and function-body AOR

Requested directly ("build both") following the research above. Two
concrete follow-ups it identified were built the same day:

**1. Chain-direction-aware ROR.** Confirmed the chained-comparison
direction rule against the Dafny Reference Manual (Sec 5.2.1–5.2.2)
directly, not just this repo's own empirical observation. New helpers
`_chain_group_ids` (partitions a clause's tokens into groups that never
cross a boolean-connective or parenthesis boundary — a conservative
approximation of Dafny's actual chain-scoping rule) and
`_chain_incompatible` (a chain link's candidate operator is incompatible
if it would mix an ascending relation with a descending one against its
chain siblings; `==`/`!=` are always compatible) are wired into
`_generate_token_mutants` via a new `chain_aware` parameter, used only
by `generate_ror_mutants` (`&&`/`||`/arithmetic operators have no
analogous chaining rule). Result: the 4 mutants that used to reach real
Dafny invocation and come back `unclassifiable` (a genuine parse error)
are now filtered before generation ever reaches verification — a new
`filtered_chain_incompatible` outcome bucket, distinct from pass 1's
`filtered_static` (a different reason: syntactic invalidity, not
semantic redundancy). MutDafny itself does not do this (its own
pipeline buckets these post-hoc as `Invalid`) — a genuine improvement
over the published state of the art, not parity with it.

**2. Function-body AOR, MutDafny-restricted.** `generate_aor_mutants`
gained an optional `function_name` parameter; when given, also scans
that function's BODY for arithmetic operators via two new helpers:
`_find_function_body_span` (brace-matched, mirroring
`dafny_spec_lint._find_method_header`'s depth-tracking but returning the
body content rather than the header preceding it) and
`_locate_function_body_arithmetic_sites` (refuses outright, rather than
risk a misaligned offset, if the body contains a `//` comment — none
does today, checked). `_TOKEN_SPAN_RE` gained `ASSIGN` (`:=`) and `SEMI`
(`;`) token kinds, needed for body statements
(`var rawDose := infusionRateMlPerHr * concentrationMgPerMl;`) but never
present in requires/ensures clauses. `_ar_group_incompatible` applies
MutDafny's own restriction directly (Amaral, Mendes & Campos 2025):
`+`/`-`/`*` freely interchange; `/` only interchanges with `%` (absent
from this spec), so a mutation can never introduce `/` where the
original had none — the division-by-zero false-kill risk named when AOR
was originally deferred is eliminated by construction, not by post-hoc
failure-reason attribution. `generate_mutants` gained the same
`function_name` parameter, and the real caller
(`run_mutation_suite.py`) now passes `"ExpectedDose"`.

**Real re-run against `dosage.dfy::CalculateHourlyDose`, both
extensions active: 42 mutants — 31 killed, 6 filtered_static, 4
filtered_chain_incompatible, 1 filtered_ar_group_incompatible, zero
survived, zero unclassifiable.** The 3 new function-body AOR mutants:
`* -> +` and `* -> -` both real-verified and genuinely **killed**
(confirming `*` is load-bearing — mutating it breaks the pinning
clause's proof, exactly as expected since the method body's own,
unmutated computation of `rawDose` then diverges from the mutated
`ExpectedDose`'s); `* -> /` filtered before verification, as designed.
The chain-incompatible mutants that used to be `unclassifiable`: gone,
replaced by 4 `filtered_chain_incompatible` records, same underlying
mutants, correctly attributed pre-verification now instead of post-hoc.

**Then built the same day:** the ≥0.01 mL/hr clinical-precision-floor
guidance from the same research — it bounds literal-value-replacement
(LVR) mutants specifically (a *magnitude* concept), a mutation class
Gate C5's original six-operator scope never included. See the LVR
extension section below.

**Tests:** `tests/test_dafny_mutate.py` grew from 11 to 19 (new:
chain-direction filtering on the real spec, a direct synthetic
tokenizer test for `:=`/`;`, direct unit tests of
`_chain_incompatible`/`_ar_group_incompatible` against hand-derived
cases independent of the real spec, function-body AOR generation and
its division-free restriction, `_locate_function_body_arithmetic_sites`
finds exactly the one `*`). `tests/test_mutation_report.py` grew from 5
to 7 (replaced the "4 unclassifiable, all chain-direction" regression
with "zero survivors AND zero unclassifiable," added a direct check on
the function-body AOR outcomes). Full suite: **131 passed** (105 +
Gate C5 v1's 16 + this extension's 10).

### LVR extension, same day: every hand-derived prediction confirmed exactly

Requested directly: "scope out Gate C5's LVR extension," then "go" once
the sub-plan (payloadguard-evidence-roadmap-phaseB-to-C.md's "Gate C5
LVR extension" section) was written. Tests whether a comparison's
LITERAL CONSTANT is load-bearing, not just its operator (ROR) or the
arithmetic combining it (AOR). Every numeric literal in `dosage.dfy`'s
requires/ensures clauses and `ExpectedDose`'s function body was
enumerated by running the real tokenizer — **all 7 are exactly `0.0`**;
no other numeric constant exists anywhere in the spec.

**Value-selection strategy:** exactly `original ± 0.01` per site — the
clinical-precision floor from the earlier research, finally applied (it
was always scoped to literal perturbation specifically). Deliberately
the sharpest possible test, not an open-ended range: if a proof survives
the smallest clinically-distinguishable nudge, it survives a larger one
too; if it's killed by the smallest nudge, that's the tightest possible
confirmation.

**Static filter, generalizing ROR's polarity principle from
operator-implication to magnitude-implication:** `_lvr_trivial`
normalizes every comparison to whether increasing the literal narrows
(strengthens) or widens (weakens) the constraint — `expr > L`/`expr >=
L` (literal on the right) narrows as L increases; so does `L <=
expr`/`L < expr` (literal on the left, an equivalent "expr >= L"
constraint); the other two operator/side combinations widen as L
increases. From there, ROR's own rule applies unchanged: narrowing is
trivial for `requires` (skip), widening is trivial for `ensures` (skip).
**EQ/NE literals have no such filter at all** — changing an equality's
target value is neither a superset nor subset of the original in either
direction — always sent to real verification. **Function-body literals
have no requires/ensures role to apply the principle to at all** — sent
straight to verification unfiltered, mirroring AOR's function-body
precedent.

**Real run matched the scoping session's hand-derived prediction exactly,
site by site:** 14 raw mutants (7 sites × 2 candidates), 4 filtered as
`filtered_magnitude_implied`, 10 sent to real verification — **all 10
genuinely killed, zero survivors.** Confirmed examples: widening
`concentrationMgPerMl > 0.0` to `> -0.01` is killed via `ExpectedDose`'s
own unchanged `requires > 0.0` at the pinning clause's call site (a
precondition-call violation, not a postcondition failure — still a
correct, real kill); narrowing `0.0 <= dose <= maxSafeDoseMgPerHr`'s
first literal to `0.01 <= dose` is killed since the implementation
genuinely produces `dose == 0.0` exactly on reverse flow; both
function-body literal mutants (the `< 0.0` comparison threshold and the
bare `then 0.0` return value) are killed because any mismatch between
`ExpectedDose`'s mutated definition and the method body's unchanged,
actual computation breaks the pinning clause for some input in the
perturbed range. The one named, unresolved tension from scoping (whether
the clinical floor is the right test for REQ-GIP-1-8-1's *exact-zero*
safety requirement specifically) didn't need resolving to get a clean
result here — the function-body zero-literal mutant was killed at the
±0.01 granularity regardless — but the underlying judgment call remains
open for whenever a different domain or requirement makes it matter.

**Combined final state across all five operator classes:** 56 mutants —
41 killed, 6 filtered_static, 4 filtered_chain_incompatible, 1
filtered_ar_group_incompatible, 4 filtered_magnitude_implied — **zero
survived, zero unclassifiable.**

**Tests:** `tests/test_dafny_mutate.py` grew from 19 to 25 (new:
literal-site location with correct comparison-operand/side tracking on
the real spec, a refusal test for a hypothetical non-adjacent literal,
function-body literal-site location, a direct unit test of
`_lvr_trivial` against hand-derived cases independent of the real spec,
a check that the generation-time half of the prediction — 14 raw, 4
filtered — matches, and a byte-level check that mutation changes exactly
the targeted literal). `tests/test_mutation_report.py` grew from 7 to 8
(a direct check that all 10 real-verified LVR candidates are killed,
locking in the real-verification half of the prediction against the
committed capture). Full suite: **138 passed** (131 + 7 new).

## Phase C Gate C6 — NL-dialogue confirmation: BUILT and SIGNED OFF (2026-07-07)

### What this gate is for

Per the roadmap, Gate C6 is a process-control fix aimed directly at
recurrence of Gate 1's original finding: a spec/requirement-text mismatch
that was caught only at review time, not authoring time. The fix is to
generate a plain-English summary of what a Dafny method's contract
actually asserts and get explicit human sign-off that the summary matches
intent, at the time the spec is authored. The roadmap is explicit that
"the actual artifact is a recorded decision... not a database entry" —
the summary generator is a means to that end, not the deliverable itself.

### What was built

`evidence/dafny_nl_summary.py::summarize_method(source, method_name)`
does two honest, mechanical things and nothing more:

1. Extracts each requires/ensures clause verbatim (ground truth), plus
   any `REQ-ID` cited in a trailing `//` comment, exactly as authored —
   never inferred from the method name or surrounding prose.
2. Produces a best-effort English "gloss" of each clause via a small,
   fixed operator-substitution table (`&&`/`||`/`==>`/`<==>`/comparisons
   → words). Labeled explicitly as a template, not comprehension — the
   raw clause is always shown first and is the authoritative artifact.

Reuses `evidence/dafny_spec_lint.py`'s existing, already-tested Gate C3
parsing surface (`_find_method_header`, `_parse_params`,
`extract_requires_clauses`, `extract_ensures_clauses`) rather than
reimplementing Dafny parsing. Citation extraction needed a separate,
comment-preserving line-based scan (`_extract_annotated_clauses`), since
the existing extractors strip comments before this module ever sees the
text.

### Scope boundary, checked not assumed

Only single-line requires/ensures clauses are supported — true of every
real clause in this repo today. A multi-line clause would silently break
the citation-association logic if unnoticed, so `summarize_method()`
cross-checks its own line-based extraction against `dafny_spec_lint`'s
canonical, multi-line-capable extractor and refuses (`SystemExit`, Tier
1) on any mismatch, rather than risk a dropped or misattributed citation.

**Self-caught bug:** the first draft of that refusal check compared
clause *counts* between the two extractors, not content. Manual testing
against a synthetic multi-line `requires x > 0\n  && x < 100` clause
found this didn't raise — both extractors happened to return the same
count (1) even though the line-based scan had silently truncated to just
`x > 0`, dropping the `&& x < 100` continuation, while the canonical
extractor correctly joined the whole clause. Same count, silently wrong
content. Fixed by comparing whitespace-normalized clause text instead of
counts; re-verified the multi-line case now raises correctly and the real
`dosage.dfy` spec still summarizes correctly. Caught and corrected before
the test suite was even written, matching this repo's established
"verify empirically, don't assume" discipline (e.g. Gate C4's self-caught
500.0-vs-50.0 wrong-value mistake).

### Tests and verification

`tests/test_dafny_nl_summary.py` — 7 tests: parameters and preconditions
listed correctly against the real `dosage.dfy` spec; each postcondition
cites the right requirement (or explicitly "no requirement cited" for the
pinning clause, which cites none) — the load-bearing property, since a
wrong citation here is exactly the defect class this gate exists to
catch; common operators glossed to words; the multi-line refusal
regression described above; a method with no requires/ensures still
summarizes cleanly; and output is byte-identical across repeated calls
(no timestamps or randomness, since this feeds a committed artifact).
Full suite after this gate: **105 passed** (98 prior + 7 new).

### The sign-off itself

`examples/dosage_calculator/nl_confirmation_dosage_dfy.md` records the
actual deliverable: the generated summary for
`dosage.dfy::CalculateHourlyDose` was presented to Steven, who confirmed
it 2026-07-07 ("it's good for the spec as is"). He also flagged a
next-phase item at sign-off time — adapting the spec and explaining, for
a regulatory submission, how results get analyzed by downstream software
— which he explicitly scoped out as separate follow-up work, not part of
this gate's deliverable.

**Explicitly not done here:** this gate is not wired into
`build_matrix()`, `generate_artifacts.py`, or any other generator, and no
automated mechanism forces future Dafny specs through it — it is a
process habit applied by whoever authors a spec, matching the roadmap's
own framing ("no technical dependency on any other Gate C item... adopt
it as a habit"). The next-phase adaptation/regulatory-analysis work
Steven flagged is not started and is not part of this gate.

## Gate 2 / C2-C4 wiring — real Dafny evidence reaches a live matrix row (2026-07-07)

Requested directly: "we need z3 integration and invocation in order to
reach PROVEN status, in concurrence with gate 5 extension." Before
building, three genuinely consequential design decisions were confirmed
with Steven rather than guessed at — this is the single highest-stakes
change to this repository's structural guarantees since ruling R1 itself
(the first time PROVEN would ever appear in a live rendered row):

1. **Scope: variant C only, for now.** "hmm. can we post hoc verify A
   and B after C variant is proven?" — variants A and B are deliberately,
   explicitly deferred. This creates a real, temporary cross-variant
   divergence (below), named and tracked, not silently permitted.
2. **The Z3 gate lives inside the binder itself** (`dafny_record()`),
   not as a separate pipeline stage — mirrors how `symbolic_record`/
   `concrete_record` already refuse on failed captures internally.
3. **Metadata declares the dafny evidence explicitly** (`evidence:
   [{method: dafny, spec_target: ..., dafny_method: ...}]`), consistent
   with Gate 4/5's existing declaration pattern, cross-checked by a new
   Gate 2 CONFLICT Type 1 sub-check rather than bound unconditionally.

### What was built

- **`metadata.schema.c.json`**: `method: dafny` added to the evidence
  enum, with `spec_target` and `dafny_method` required together (via a
  new `allOf` conditional, alongside the existing `concrete_test`/
  `test_id` one).
- **`metadata.c.yaml`**: `evidence: [{method: dafny, spec_target:
  "dosage.dfy", dafny_method: "CalculateHourlyDose"}]` added to
  REQ-GIP-1-4-12 and REQ-GIP-1-8-1 — exactly the two requirements
  `intended_method: "PROVEN"` has named since Phase A/B, and exactly the
  two `dosage.dfy`'s own header comment scopes itself to.
- **`evidence/conflict.py::dafny_binding_conflicts`**: Type 1 identity
  check for dafny evidence — does the declared `spec_target` match the
  file the captured Dafny manifest actually verified? Deliberately a
  no-op when `dafny_store is None` (not merely falsy) — a symbolic/
  concrete build_matrix() call that never intended to bind dafny
  evidence must not be penalized for metadata that also declares it for
  the third view. `run_conflict_gate` gained an optional `dafny_store`
  parameter, defaulting to None everywhere except the new "c-formal"
  call.
- **`evidence/render/matrix_variants.py::dafny_record()`**: the wiring
  itself. Gates PROVEN on two independent, real checks before ever
  constructing a record: (1) `evidence.dafny_spec_lint.check_precondition_satisfiability`
  (Gate C3 vector 1) — refuses if unsat; (2)
  `evidence.dafny_adapter.parse_dafny_capture` (Gate C1) — refuses on
  any non-clean signal, already covering the false-zero guard and the
  Gate C3 vector 3 hardening. `assert_no_realized_proven`'s ruling R3
  still independently re-checks `method`/`verifier_completion_status` at
  the matrix boundary — this function satisfying both today doesn't
  change that; R3 doesn't trust this function's own diligence, by
  design.
- **`_bind_self_describing`** gained an optional `dafny_store` parameter
  (default `None` — "this call doesn't bind dafny evidence at all",
  declared entries silently ignored, not an error — vs. an explicit dict,
  even empty, meaning "this call does bind dafny evidence, and an
  unresolved declared entry is a real refusal"). This `is not None`
  vs. truthiness distinction is what keeps `c-symbolic`/`c-concrete`
  byte-behaviorally unchanged (aside from one new, always-null field,
  below) while enabling `c-formal`.
- **`_shape_method_partitioned`** gained a `dafny` method-filter branch
  and now always carries `verifier_completion_status` on every rendered
  row (previously absent) — load-bearing for R3's row-level check on
  variant C's shape; a harmless `null` no-op for crosshair/concrete_test
  rows, since R3 only inspects it when `strength == "PROVEN"`.
- **`_VARIANT_SPECS`/`_ARTIFACT_TITLES`/`_MARKDOWN_RENDERERS`** gained
  `"c-formal"` entries. `build_matrix()` gained an optional `dafny_store`
  parameter, threaded through to both the binder and the conflict gate.
- **`generate_matrix_c.py`** now renders THREE artifacts
  (`traceability_matrix.formal.json/.md` alongside the existing
  symbolic/concrete pair), assembling `dafny_store` from the real,
  already-committed Gate C1 capture (`dosage.dfy`, `raw_dafny_output.txt`,
  `run_manifest_dafny.json`) — no re-running evidence inside the
  generation pipeline, same discipline as every other capture in this
  repo. Only the formal call's `tool_versions` gains a `"dafny"` key;
  symbolic/concrete's stays exactly as before (confirmed by diff — this
  matters for `tests/test_cli.py`'s byte-comparison, which is unaffected
  since the CLI was deliberately NOT extended with a `"c-formal"` variant
  choice this session — named as a deferred scope decision, matching the
  same phased spirit as variants A/B, not an oversight).

### The result: REQ-GIP-1-4-12 and REQ-GIP-1-8-1 are formally proven, for real

`traceability_matrix.formal.json` — 3 rows: two real PROVEN rows
(`method: "dafny"`, `verifier_completion_status: "completed"`,
`intent_ok: true`) and the pre-existing `system_scope` GAP row for
REQ-GIP-1-4-12 (unchanged in kind, still correctly deferred to
integration testing — a kernel-level Dafny proof says nothing about
whether an integrated system raises the physical alarm signal).
`intent_ok` flips from `False` to `True` for both requirements in this
view — the first time since Phase A that `intended_method: "PROVEN"` has
actually been realized, not just declared.

### The temporary variant A/B divergence — named, tracked, not silently permitted

Since variants A and B don't (yet) bind dafny evidence, their own
`intent_ok` for these two requirements stays `False` — a REAL divergence
from the formal view's `True`, exactly as expected given the phased
scope decision above. The existing fact-equality gate
(`evidence/reconcile.py::run_gate`, `VARIANT_ARTIFACTS`) is deliberately
**unchanged** — `traceability_matrix.formal.json` is not in
`VARIANT_ARTIFACTS` and never touches that gate, so the pre-existing,
strict A==B==symbolic==concrete check keeps passing exactly as before
(confirmed: `intent {'REQ-GIP-1-4-12': False, 'REQ-GIP-1-8-1': False,
'REQ-DOSE-003': True}` — byte-identical to before this wiring).

A new, separate, narrowly-scoped check —
`evidence/reconcile.py::run_formal_check` — verifies the formal view's
divergence is EXACTLY the expected one and no other:
`KNOWN_FORMAL_INTENT_DIVERGENCE = frozenset({"REQ-GIP-1-4-12",
"REQ-GIP-1-8-1"})`. Any OTHER requirement diverging is still a hard
failure (`unexpected divergence`); either named requirement diverging in
the WRONG direction (i.e. not `True`) is also a hard failure (`expected
... to be newly proven`) — defense against a corrupted regeneration
silently passing. Wired into `regenerate_all.py` right after the main
fact-equality gate, printing its own PASS line. This carve-out is meant
to be temporary: once variant A/B's own dafny wiring lands, it should be
removed and `run_formal_check` tightened to plain equality (or folded
into `run_gate` outright) — tracked here as the explicit follow-up, not
assumed to happen automatically.

### Tests and verification

`tests/test_dafny_wiring.py` — 15 tests: the real formal artifact has
exactly the two expected PROVEN rows, each satisfying R3; the real
formal artifact passes `assert_no_realized_proven` for real (not a
synthetic fixture); symbolic/concrete/A/B are confirmed completely
unaffected (regression); `dafny_record` refuses an unsatisfiable
precondition and a broken capture (both gates independently exercised);
`dafny_record` accepts the real committed capture; `dafny_binding_conflicts`
catches a spec_target mismatch, a missing capture, and correctly no-ops
when `dafny_store is None`; the real metadata + dafny store combination
has zero conflicts; `run_formal_check` passes on the real committed
artifacts and correctly rejects both an unnamed divergence and a
wrong-direction divergence of a named one; and an end-to-end
`build_matrix("c-formal", ...)` call matches the committed artifact
byte-for-byte. Full suite after this wiring: **93 passed** (78 prior +
15 new). Full `generate_artifacts.py` pipeline re-run end to end,
including the new formal-view check: **PASS**, with the structural
PROVEN sweep (stage 6) now explicitly sweeping
`traceability_matrix.formal.json` too — proving ruling R3 accepts this
real row inside the actual pipeline, not just when
`generate_matrix_c.py` happens to be run standalone.

### Explicitly not done here (as of the variant-C-only build; SUPERSEDED for A/B — see below)

- ~~Variants A and B don't bind dafny evidence at all — deliberately
  deferred, per the ratified scope decision.~~ **Done same day** — see
  "Gate 2/C2-C4 wiring extended to variants A and B" below.
- ~~The CLI was not extended with a `"c-formal"` variant choice or a way
  to supply a `dafny_store` from the command line.~~ **Done same day** —
  `--dafny-captures` landed as part of the A/B extension (it turned out
  not to be optional: once metadata.a.yaml/metadata.b.yaml declared
  dafny evidence, the CLI genuinely could not build those variants
  without it — see below).
- **No generic "wire any future Dafny spec into the matrix" tooling.**
  Still true: this built the ONE wiring path for the ONE spec that
  exists (`dosage.dfy`), the same scope discipline every other Gate C
  mechanism in this repository has followed.

### Gate 2/C2-C4 wiring extended to variants A and B (2026-07-07)

Requested directly, same day as the variant-C-only build: "go ahead and
extend variant A and B now." Confirms the "post hoc" framing from the
scope decision that shipped C first — this is that follow-up landing.

**Declarations.** `metadata.a.yaml` gained `- method: dafny, spec_target:
"dosage.dfy", dafny_method: "CalculateHourlyDose"` in REQ-GIP-1-4-12 and
REQ-GIP-1-8-1's `evidence` lists — the same declaration style Gate 4/5
already established for crosshair/concrete_test.
`evidence/schema/metadata.schema.a.json` gained the matching `dafny`
enum value and `spec_target`/`dafny_method` conditional (identical fix
to what schema.c.json got when C was wired). `metadata.b.yaml` gained
two new shadow pseudo-requirements, `REQ-GIP-1-4-12.formal-1` and
`REQ-GIP-1-8-1.formal-1`, with `implementation: "dosage.dfy::CalculateHourlyDose"` -
the SAME shadow pattern concrete evidence already uses
(`parent_requirement` + implementation), but distinguished as a dafny
shadow by the `.dfy` file extension rather than a separate declared
field. `evidence/schema/metadata.schema.b.json`'s shadow-id pattern was
extended from `\.concrete-[0-9]+` to `\.(concrete|formal)-[0-9]+` to
allow it.

**Binders.** `_bind_declared` (variant A) and `_bind_shadow` (variant B)
both gained an optional `dafny_store` parameter and the same dafny-
record construction `_bind_self_describing` already had — but with a
different default-None behavior, deliberately: variant A/B have no
concept of "a view that legitimately excludes dafny evidence" the way
C's symbolic/concrete sub-views do (their single artifact renders every
declared evidence type together), so a requirement declaring dafny
evidence with no `dafny_store` provided at all is refused outright
(`SystemExit`), not silently skipped. `_bind_shadow` distinguishes a
dafny shadow from a concrete one by checking whether the implementation
file ends in `.dfy` — no new declared field needed, since the file
extension is already meaningfully informative (a real, existing
convention, not a new hack). `_shape_flattened_shadow` (variant B's row
shape) gained the same `verifier_completion_status` field
`_shape_method_partitioned` already carries, load-bearing for ruling
R3's row-level check.

**CONFLICT Type 1 generalized, not duplicated.** `_declared_concrete_bindings`
(the existing generator unifying variant A's evidence-list declarations
and variant B's shadow rows for concrete evidence) needed a real fix: it
previously treated EVERY shadow row's implementation suffix as a
concrete test_id unconditionally, which would have mis-parsed a dafny
shadow's `dafny_method` as a bogus test_id and crashed with a false
"declared test_id not found" error. Fixed to skip `.dfy`-suffixed shadow
rows (now correctly recognized as dafny bindings, not concrete ones). A
new, parallel generator, `_declared_dafny_bindings`, unifies dafny's own
two declaration shapes (A/C's evidence list, B's `.dfy`-suffixed shadow
rows) the same way — `dafny_binding_conflicts` was rewritten to use it,
so Type 1 now genuinely covers variant B's dafny bindings too, not just
A/C's.

**Intent parity required extending dafny_store to symbolic/concrete too,
not just formal.** `generate_matrix_c.py` now passes `dafny_store` to
ALL THREE of its `build_matrix()` calls, not only `"c-formal"` — a real,
necessary consequence of extending A/B: since `derive_intent()` runs
inside each `build_matrix()` call using that call's own bound records,
`c-symbolic`/`c-concrete` would otherwise keep computing `intent_ok =
False` for the two now-proven requirements while A/B (and formal) say
`True`, breaking the fact-equality gate for real. Their RENDERED rows
are unaffected either way (the shape function still filters to
crosshair/concrete_test only) — only their internal intent computation
changes. Only `"c-formal"`'s header advertises the dafny tool version;
symbolic/concrete's stays crosshair-only, since only formal actually
renders a dafny row (verified by diff).

**The fact-equality gate itself required two real changes, not zero.**
`evidence/reconcile.py::VARIANT_ARTIFACTS` now includes
`traceability_matrix.formal.json` as a full fifth member — no longer
carved out. `facts_c` is now the union of symbolic, concrete, AND formal
(previously symbolic ∪ concrete only), representing variant C's true
three-way total claim against A's and B's single-artifact totality. The
intent comparison changed from strict dict equality to **subset
comparison**: `traceability_matrix.formal.json` will *permanently* lack
an opinion about REQ-DOSE-003 (dosage.dfy's own header comment
explicitly excludes it — this is not a temporary gap, it's a real,
durable scope boundary), so requiring its intent dict to be identical to
A's (which always has an opinion about every requirement) was never
going to hold. The new rule: every requirement a view DOES have an
opinion about must still match the reference exactly; a view is free to
have no opinion about a requirement it doesn't cover; a requirement id
the reference has never heard of at all is still a hard failure. The
temporary carve-out mechanism (`run_formal_check`,
`KNOWN_FORMAL_INTENT_DIVERGENCE`) built for the C-only phase is now
retired — deleted from `evidence/reconcile.py`, its call removed from
`regenerate_all.py` — since the divergence it tracked is closed.

**The CLI needed `--dafny-captures`, and this was not optional.** Once
`metadata.a.yaml`/`metadata.b.yaml` declared dafny evidence,
`python -m evidence.cli build --variant a ...` genuinely broke
(`build_matrix()` refuses without a `dafny_store`) — this is a real
regression the A/B extension would otherwise have introduced, not a
nice-to-have. `evidence/cli.py` gained `--dafny-captures <index.json>`:
a small JSON file mapping `"{spec_target}::{dafny_method}"` keys to
*paths* (relative to the index file's own directory) for the spec
source, raw output, and manifest, rather than embedding the actual file
content inline (keeps the index small and hand-readable).
`examples/dosage_calculator/dafny_captures_index.json` is the real,
committed index for the worked example. `"c-formal"` was also added to
the CLI's variant choices (deferred in the C-only build; needed now that
the CLI is being extended anyway).

**The result:** every variant artifact — A, B, C-symbolic, C-concrete,
C-formal — now reports `intent_ok: true` for both REQ-GIP-1-4-12 and
REQ-GIP-1-8-1. `run_gate()`'s facts count is **9**, not 7. Full test
suite: **98 passed** (added `test_reconcile_intent_comparison_is_subset_not_strict_equality`,
`test_variant_a_has_dafny_evidence_and_a_proven_record`,
`test_variant_b_has_dafny_shadow_rows_and_a_proven_record`,
`test_cli_build_matches_committed_with_dafny_captures`,
`test_cli_refuses_variant_a_without_dafny_captures`, and more, in
`tests/test_dafny_wiring.py`; updated `tests/test_cli.py` and
`tests/test_fact_equality.py` for the new committed reality). Full
`generate_artifacts.py` pipeline re-run end to end: PASS.

**Explicitly not done here:** no generic "wire any future Dafny spec
into the matrix" tooling — this extended the ONE wiring path to the
existing metadata for the ONE spec that exists.

## What's left for Gate 2

- CONFLICT rule Type 1: **built AND folded into `build_matrix()`**
  (`evidence/conflict.py`; runs on every `build_matrix()` call, tested
  across all three metadata shapes including variant C, plus a dedicated
  fold-in proof). The frozen base matrix keeps its own explicit check
  (`generate_artifacts.py::stage_base_conflict_check`, since it never
  calls `build_matrix()`).
- CONFLICT rule Type 2: **built**, standalone stage
  (`generate_artifacts.py`, `evidence/conflict.py`) — confirmed to have
  no per-variant home (it's a whole-manifest-set check, like
  fact-equality), so it correctly stays outside `build_matrix()`.
- Binding authorship (Gate 4): decided (option 3) and now implemented
  for all three metadata shapes — variant C's asymmetry is closed.
- Vocabulary-agnostic binder: **Steps 1–4 done.** `build_matrix()` is
  the sole implementation across all four variants, runs CONFLICT Type 1
  internally, and all three generator scripts plus the CLI call it. The
  Step 2 fallback functions (`build_matrix_variant_a/b/c`) and the
  equivalence test that existed to check against them
  (`tests/test_binder_equivalence.py`) are deleted, per Steven's
  direction to get the CLI landed first — git history holds them if
  ever needed again.
- CLI: **built** (`evidence/cli.py`, `python -m evidence.cli build`) —
  proven byte-identical to committed artifacts across all four variants,
  plus Tier-1 error-path coverage (`tests/test_cli.py`, 10 tests).
- **Nothing remains for Gate 2's build.** The only open item in Gate 2's
  scope at all is the CONFLICT rule definition, and that's already
  ratified (see above) — Gate 2 is done.

## Session-scope note (2026-07-05, Turn B4)

The Phase B v3 prompt's Turn B4/B5 spec bodies arrived as placeholder
text; the companion roadmap was supplied separately and is committed as
`payloadguard-evidence-roadmap-phaseB-to-C.md` — its Gate 1 section defines
Turn B4's scope (minimal pipeline, four real variant artifacts as ground

## Renal Function Dose Adjustment POC — Phase 1 non-goals and exclusions (2026-07-08, updated same day)

Second, independent proof-of-concept (`examples/renal_adjustment/`,
Phase 1 plan committed as `examples/renal_adjustment/PHASE1_PLAN.md`,
Gate C1 signature sketches in `examples/renal_adjustment/gate_c1_sketch.md`,
Gate 1c audit in `examples/renal_adjustment/GATE_1C_AUDIT.md`),
demonstrating the Gate C1–C6 pipeline generalizes from arithmetic
clamping (`dosage.dfy`) to lookup-table and conditional-branching logic.
Gate 1a and 1b are closed; **Gate 1c has been performed and found two
real gaps — one now resolved, one deliberately deferred; Gate 1 is not
yet formally closed.** Five core proof functions (`RoundHalfUp`,
`GStage`, `SelectFormula`, `ComposedCeiling`, `AssessRenalFunction`)
verify individually against the real, installed Dafny 4.11.0 toolchain;
the composed boundary behavior (`GStage(RoundHalfUp(x))`) verifies
across all ten boundary rows plus the NHS SPS example (24/24, 0 errors);
`AssessRenalFunction`'s type-level proof that a CrCl value can never
reach `GStage` verifies at 11/11, 0 errors — but none are yet composed
into a committed `renal_adjustment.dfy`; Phase 2 has not started. Named
limitations/exclusions and open gaps, per this repo's "name it, don't
guess it" discipline:

- **No function computes the actual Cockcroft-Gault CrCl or CKD-EPI
  eGFR numeric value.** Found by Gate 1c's hand-trace, not assumed away:
  the skeleton only stages/selects/composes an already-computed value.
  The exact CKD-EPI 2021 equations and Cockcroft-Gault's historical
  constants are now independently verified (see
  `sources/ckd-epi-2021-and-cockcroft-gault-verification.md`), and a
  proposed Dafny/Z3 lookup-table workaround for CKD-EPI's fractional
  exponents was evaluated and found to relocate rather than eliminate
  the trust boundary (the LUT itself needs independent verification
  against the formula). Needs a scope decision (Cockcroft-Gault in
  Phase 2 — small, linear-arithmetic, low proof risk — vs. CKD-EPI
  caller-supplied, given its genuine Dafny/Z3 expressiveness gap, not
  just a performance concern) — see `GATE_1C_AUDIT.md`'s addenda.
  **Deliberately deferred, not decided**, now backed by verified data
  rather than an open question mark.
- **`GStage` must not be applied to a Cockcroft-Gault CrCl value —
  RESOLVED 2026-07-08.** Its boundaries are derived from KDIGO's
  eGFR-specific G1–G5 table; CrCl isn't BSA-normalized and isn't staged
  the same way clinically. Found via hand-tracing the NHS SPS example
  (CrCl 37 vs. eGFR 53, the same divergence that motivates
  REQ-RENAL-2's formula-selection branch). Fixed by a dispatcher
  function, `AssessRenalFunction`, whose tagged-union return type
  (`EGFRAssessment` vs. `CrClAssessment`) makes the category error a
  type-level impossibility rather than a calling convention — see
  `gate_c1_sketch.md` section 5 and `GATE_1C_AUDIT.md`'s addendum.

- **Per-drug numeric dose-reduction factors are not sourced or proven.**
  BNF/SPC/Renal Drug Handbook disagree at the individual-drug level.
  Scoped as a versioned, human-signed-off configuration input (Gate
  C6-style), mirroring how `dosage.dfy` treats `maxSafeDoseMgPerHr` as a
  parameter, not a baked-in constant. The proof establishes correct,
  monotonic, bounded *application* of a supplied factor, not the
  clinical correctness of the factor's numeric value.
- **Paediatric renal dosing is out of scope for v1 — settled, not just
  assumed.** No free UK paediatric renal-dosing standard exists at the
  level of the adult sources used here; explicit adult-only precondition.
- **Combined creatinine-cystatin C eGFR (eGFRcr-cys) is settled as named,
  not built.** A closed-form 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin-C equation
  exists and is fully provable (Inker et al., *NEJM* 2021;385(19):1737–
  1749, PMID 34554658, verified directly against PubMed) — not a
  feasibility gap — but cystatin C isn't routinely measured in UK
  practice, making the branch near-permanently unreachable with real
  data. Documented as a future extension.
- **`REQ-RENAL-3`'s original "unstable renal function" framing was never
  independently corroborated** by any source fetched, and has been
  merged into `REQ-RENAL-6` (AKI reassessment) rather than kept as a
  separately-sourced claim — see `sources/kdigo-2024-gfr-staging.md` and
  `PHASE1_PLAN.md`'s requirements table.
- **New: `SelectFormula`'s drug-classification flags (`REQ-RENAL-8`) are
  caller-supplied, and their provenance is explicitly unscoped.** The
  proof establishes correct branching given the flags, not that a given
  real-world drug was correctly classified — MHRA's own drug lists are
  illustrative, not closed, so hardcoding them would embed a
  false-completeness claim inside a formally "proven" artifact. Who sets
  the flags and by what process is a named, deferred item needing its
  own scoping pass before Phase 2 can treat this trust boundary as
  closed — see `PHASE1_PLAN.md`'s "Still open" section.
